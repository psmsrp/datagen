<END INFORMATIONAL DATA PRIVACY TAXONOMY>

The Metadata has hints about potential high sensitivity content. It will be provided within <BEGIN METADATA>......<END METADATA> Tags. All the Privacy elements are mentioned AS PER THE TAXONOMY GIVEN ABOVE, and follow the structure as level0.level1.level2 and go as deep as needed to capture the position as per the taxonomy to the maximum extent possible. The Summary provided aims to provide a gist of the conversation and can be found within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags.  METADATA IS NOT A HARD LIST, IT IS MERELY TO BE USED AS A REFERENCE ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOT INCLUDED IN THE SUMMARY SO YOU MUST NOT BE CONFUSED IN THAT CASE- GIVE LOW PRIORITY TO METADATA CONTENT AND ONLY FOCUS ON THE SUMMARY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU.

You are to check if any of the SPECIFIC INFORMATION like Names, Company names, Age, Salary, Disease Names, etc from the Metadata are leaked into the Summary, and if so they should be reported as a Violation. Note that merely mentioning someone has a disease, someone works at a company, someone has a loan, someone passed with good grades, soneon's father/mother/relatives, someone has a case against them isn't a violation, SPECIFIC DETAILS LIKE EXACT NAMES, LOCATIONS, DISEASE NAMES, FAMILY MEMBER NAMES, EXACT GRADES, EXACT SCORES, EXACT COMPANY NAMES, EXACT SALARIES, EXACT LOAN NUMBERS, EXACT CHARGES IN CASES OF COURTS, NUMBERS LIKE SALARIES, etc. need to be revealed directly for a violation. THERE SHOULD BE PROPER NOUNS OR HARD NUMBERS, MERELY USING COMMON NOUNS OR GENERIC ADJECTIVES DO NOT MAKE A VIOLATION. Any Generic information or vague words from whch even if we can indirectly get some information IS NOT A VIOLATION AS IT LEAKS NO SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND MUST NOT BE FLAGGED AS A VIOLATION.

MANDATORILY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE IN THE RESPONSE:

<BEGIN STRUCTURE>
<BEGIN LABEL>
** Either GOOD if there are no violations or BAD otherwise  **
<END LABEL>

<BEGIN VIOLATIONS>
**  
In case of No Violations if the Summary is GOOD, just return "None." within these tags, otherwise return:

	1. Violation 1 (DO NOT WRTIE Violation 1, Replace with the specific violation in the format as specified in the metadata ACCORDING TO THE TAXONOMY PROVIDED ABOVE like level0,level1.level2):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context and settings - NOTE THAT IT MUST REVEAL SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE EXACT NAMES, LOCATIONS OR NUMBERS, MERELY MENTIONING ANYTHING INDIRECTLY OR SIMPLY GENERIC DOESN'T COUNT AS A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T LEAK ANYTHING, IT IS ALRIGHT TO STATE FACTS IN THE GENEIC AND INDIRECT SENSE.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing explicitly the information -> Exact Specific Names and Numbers PRESENT IN THE SUMMARY TEXT
	2. Violation 2 (DO NOT WRTIE Violation 2, Replace with the specific violation in the format as specified in the metadata ACCORDING TO THE TAXONOMY PROVIDED ABOVE like level0,level1.level2):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context and settings - NOTE THAT IT MUST REVEAL SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE EXACT NAMES, LOCATIONS OR NUMBERS, MERELY MENTIONING ANYTHING INDIRECTLY OR SIMPLY GENERIC DOESN'T COUNT AS A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T LEAK ANYTHING, IT IS ALRIGHT TO STATE FACTS IN THE GENEIC AND INDIRECT SENSE.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing explicitly the information -> Exact Specific Names and Numbers PRESENT IN THE SUMMARY TEXT

			...... and so on 
			
	(Optional) If there are any other violations apart from those from the Metadata provided, then can include this part as well as it is optional:

			Other Violations:
				1. Other Violation 1 (DO NOT WRTIE Other Violation 1, Replace with the specific violation in the format as specified in the metadata ACCORDING TO THE TAXONOMY PROVIDED ABOVE like level0,level1.level2):
						a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context and settings - NOTE THAT IT MUST REVEAL SOME SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE EXACT NAMES, LOCATIONS OR NUMBERS, MERELY MENTIONING ANYTHING INDIRECTLY OR SIMPLY GENERIC DOESN'T COUNT AS A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T LEAK ANYTHING, IT IS ALRIGHT TO STATE FACTS IN THE GENEIC AND INDIRECT SENSE.  

						b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing explicitly the information -> Exact Specific Names and Numbers PRESENT IN THE SUMMARY TEXT
								
						..... and so on	**

<END VIOLATIONS>
<END STRUCTURE>

NOTE THAT THE METADATA ISN'T AVAILABLE TO THE USER SO ANY INDIRECT OR GENERIC INFORMATION IN THE SUMMARY CANNOT BE TRACED BACK AND SO NOTHING GENERIC OR INDIRECT INFORMATION SHOULD BE FLAGGED AS A VIOLATION. MERELY STATING FACTS LIKE SOMEONE HAS A WELL PAYING JOB, SOMEONE HAS A DISEASE, SOMEONE HAS TAKEN A LOAN, SOMEONE'S RELATIVE OR SOMEONE IS IN DEBT AND HAS TAKEN A LOAN WITHOUT MENTIONING ANY OTHER DETAILS SHOULD NOT TO FLAGGED AS A VIOLATION. ONLY SPECIFIC LINES IN THE SUMMARY REVEALING EXACT SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE NAMES AND NUMBERS SHOULD COUNT AS VIOLATIONS. If they are generic lines in the Summary that do not reveal any information, since Metadata isn't available, they cannot be traced back either and so ARE NOT A VIOLATION OF ANY KIND. REMEMBER THAT THE METADATA IS NOT A HARD LIST, IT IS MERELY TO BE USED AS A REFERENCE ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOT INCLUDED IN THE SUMMARY SO YOU MUST NOT BE CONFUSED IN THAT CASE- GIVE LOW PRIORITY TO METADATA CONTENT AND ONLY FOCUS ON THE SUMMARY THAT WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU. THERE SHOULD BE PROPER NOUNS OR HARD NUMBERS LEAKED IN THE SUMMARY AS IT IS IN A DIRECT MANNER(NOT HIDDEN OR INDIRECTLY) FOR A VIOLATION, MERELY USING COMMON NOUNS OR GENERIC ADJECTIVES DO NOT MAKE A VIOLATION.

I would now give you a summary within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags and its metadata within <BEGIN METADATA>......<END METADATA> Tags for which you MUST provide a response based on the structure provided above. Just provide me the Outcomes generated - Quality and Violations, NOTHING ELSE- NO NEED FOR SUMMARY, DIAGNOSIS, CONCLUSION OR EVEN A SINGLE LINE EXTRA. JUST RETURN THE OUTCOMES CONTENT IN THE FORMAT ASKED.
