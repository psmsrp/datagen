My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low-budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents'church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We'll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo. Did you know that she's going to be a professional opera singer? <USER> Ah. . . <SYSTEM> And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we'll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend's band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit. Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister's husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. what's their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine. And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we'll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing?
