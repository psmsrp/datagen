Zoe: We saw the oncologist today and finally know where we stand. No rush, he said, so we are relieved.
Sophie: Which therapy has he recommended?
Zoe: He reassured Bill that it's almost not recommended to have the Brachytherapy at his low level of cancer.
Sophie: Is it the one with radiation elements working from inside?
Zoe: That's right. But he says that due to the cancer being in both lobes he will do it but there is no rush. So the tension has eased off.
Sophie: Is it because there is so little cancer in the lobes?
Zoe: That's how I understand it. But there is also Bill's heart condition. The oncologist will confirm with the cardiologist when Bill can come off the blood thinner and then will perform the op.
Sophie: We were told when it was under consideration for Wolf that the op itself is a micro op, without cutting through the skin and all that.
Zoe: That's right. 40 radioactive seeds 4 mm x 1,8 mm will be inserted into the prostate via some microsurgery procedure. No scars at all.
Sophie: How long does it take to get rid of the cancerogenous tissue?
Zoe: Radiation lasts 2 years diminishing in strength every 6 months by half. And he won't be even aware of their working.
Sophie: So it is quite good news, isn't it?
Zoe: Oh yes. Bill is very happy after seeing the doctor today.
Sophie: Aren't we lucky to live in these times of really successful medicine?

Jennifer: Dear Celia! How are you doing?
Celia: The afternoon with the Collins was very pleasant, nice folks, but we missed you.
Jennifer: But I appreciate your consideration for Peter.
Celia: My dear Jenny! It turns out that my decision not to come, though I wanted so much to see you again and Peter and the Collins, was right. Yesterday it all developed into a full bore cold. Sh.....
Jennifer: All symptoms like in a text book.
Celia: Luckily it's contagious only on the first 2, 3 days, so when we meet next week it should be alright.
Jennifer: Thanks for asking! Somehow for all of us Peter comes first now.
Celia: That's too bad. Poor you...
Jennifer: I'll be driving to FR, do you want me to bring you sth? It's on my way.
Celia: Thank you dear! I was at the pharmacy yesterday and had done my shopping the day before.
Jennifer: You'd better still stay away from me in case I'm still contagious
Celia: Right. So I'll only leave a basket on your terrace. Are you in bed?
Jennifer: Goodness me - not! Actually working at the desk. A long overdue commission.
Celia: OK I won't disturb you.
Jennifer: What basket??
Celia: If you can work it can't be that bad.
Jennifer: Maria brought plenty of cookies and I still had my linzertorte, so we're glutted with cakes and you surely have none.
Celia: But you gave me two bags of almond snaps!
Jennifer: I'm so happy I've lost some weight in Mexico.
Celia: They keep forever! Why don't you share them with William? All men love linzertorte.
