I'm sure there was more calories in the oil I used this morning than the eggs I ate haha I think all oils, aka fat have very similar caloric value Coconut oil. The other oils are bad for you and olive oil does bad things when heated. I agree coconut oil or MCT oil is the best for you with no noticeable added taste I use it for cooking everything. You can even use it as lip balm or for treating dry skin and dandruff a was watching the hairy bikers diet show thing and they dry fry everything and ive started doing that. Things taste better. No oil. Just put your food in. start on a low heat and get higher Wait, wouldn't that make food stick? Not if you cook it on low first like really low then once the fats started to come out of it then crank it up a little more. and it cooks in its own oil then and doesnt stick. Also, Teflon is legit. Even the crummy $10 pan I got at walmart keeps things from sticking at all. I usually always go with olive oil and sometimes safflower oil for the health benefits for women. Avoid vegetable oil at all costs. These are polyunsaturates that cause so many health problems because they tend to become oxidized or rancid when subjected to heat, oxygen and moisture as in cooking and processing. Go for coconut and olive oil. Coconut oil is heat stable, will give you more energy and help you lose weight.

Subreddit: breakingbad Okay, so I finally finished Breaking Bad, and I have to say. I really didn't find the ending to be fulfilling. I found that Walter allowing himself to be caught kinda went against everything that he stood for. I will say that he made sure his pride was intact. There he is next to his precious cooking equipment, the great Heisenberg, the only one to take the credit for the continued Blue Meth distribution. I don't think he was the great Heisenberg at the end. Rather, he was the perfect combination of Walter and Heisenberg. In the beginning, he was proud but meek and dweeby. Hank cracked jokes about him. His students didn't respect him. Anyone could walk all over him and he hated it but he quietly took it. Over the course of the series, as the Heisenberg personality took over, he became arrogant, angry, and mean. He believed his own hype. But he had a lot of time to think up in that cabin. Not just about how to get the money to his family, but about everything that had gone on. He was able to come back down to earth. He was still confident and tough, like Heisenberg, but aware, like Walt, that he was just a man. He wasn't unstoppable or untouchable. He did everything he needed to and knew when enough was enough. He wasn't caught. He did everything he needed to do then he checked out on his terms. IMO the ending was just right I thought it was perfect for him. He had to die being the anti hero he was. I would have liked to have seen a little more of a conclusion for Jessie rather than him just speeding off though. I think any defined conclusion would have been too polarizing though. I think the open ended nature of Jesse's departure is nice because everyone has their own idea of what his future holds Hmmm. allowing himself to be caught kinda went against everything that he stood for. I believe what he ultimately stood for was himself. He didn't die from cancer. He didn't get caught by the police. He died on his own terms with a smile on his face. I also don't believe what happened to him was him allowing to get caught , rather the opposite of that in fact! He made his kids millionaires, got revenge for the murder of Hank, killed all the people who wronged him (this is debatable) and managed to save Jesse from Jacks crew. He did pay a big price by ultimately being hated by his family and known to the world as a drug kingpin, but he finally got recognition for his work, which despite being terrible, was great. Sounds like Walter wanted to be at peace with himself. It would've been cool to hear him mutter namaste as he was busted for his crimes. I believe he wanted to give up. I did everything that he loved to do, for himself, as he said. And in the end, he screwed up. He screwed his family, his friends, his life, 'cause he always had a mediocre life. Doing meth changed his life, not only for the bad reasons. He was good at it. He was happy at it. Again, he provided for his family. But he was the main reason for it. There was no going back at that point when he died. There was no fix to what he did. He was a criminal. We all love Walt and all his transformation. But all he did was bad things. Cooking and selling drugs is wrong. But he made us love him. I see his death as the perfect ending, because enough is enough. Jesse was free, his family is pretty well with all that money that Walter Jr. will receive in the future, and Walt only has to pay for all he did. The most perfect tv show that I ever have seen.

Subreddit: singing Especialy with my voice, it sounds very 'uncomfortable' and thick. Oh btw I'm a guy and I'm 20 years old, identified as 'low' baritone but I try to ignore my range limits. Yes that's me but I cant seem to get my tone very smooth. It stays in this thick way troughout my whole range. Volume control is merely how much air you push through. What do you mean by thick? As in the character of your voice? It's sound pretty light to me. It's sounds pretty uncomfortable because it's edging on using falsetto co-ordination (Breathy) and sounds like you haven't got enough support. I'm a low baritone such as yourself, but you're lightening your voice too early You have to make sure that your larynx doesn't shoot up to reach higher notes otherwise you'll strain. Can you hear the tonal differences in both recordings? I'm hitting the same notes by keeping an open palate (back of my mouth), placing my voice at the roof of my mouth, and keeping the larynx controlled, you can hit the notes with ease. Where does your voice flip? I mean, where is your natural passage? Because I haven't spoke to a low baritone before, and I am very curious. And in what kind of higher register do you sing? What kind of coordination do you use? Because I am not gifted to belt all the way up, so after something like f4 I flip to the head register. How do you maintain your vocal stamina after the passagio? Do you mix? My voice flips at B3, but I am able to belt until E4. My tessitura (comfortable vocal range) is from a G2 - C4 (It used to only go up to G3) and I can extend my full tone to a E4. I can use my falsetto down to an A3. Do you flip to head voice or falsetto though after F4? That's two different co-ordinations I use, but mainly head voice. I mix from C4 to C5. You don't need to be gifted to be belting, just don't strain. Vocalising Haaaaa to give your muscles some push can help you give the strength to your upper notes so they don't sound weak and falsetto-ey. To ensure vocal stamina, the placement of the voice must be more forward and higher in the mouth than it usually is, but not so much you sound nasal. A good amount of twang can help you project your voice as well so it sounds sharper and doesn't get dragged down by the natural darkness of a baritone voice. You can't shy away from the support too. I used to be anxious when I did higher notes, so I forgot all my support and it was real bad 3 years? I have been working on my head voice for a very long time, and it just overpowers my falsetto in terms of dynamics. Falsetto is not my cup of tea. So when I'm belting from my modal register, i flip around the f4, and then you hear this very scratchy head voice. But when I tend to sing with this weird open sensation from my ears, it sounds brighter and more steady. Maybe this is the palate thing, but with my chest voice it tends to be harder lol. It depends on how I'm feeling. I just like my head voice very much. I can sing from a E3 to a scratchy G5. So my lowest modal note would be a forced c#2. It is safer to state that my modal register spans E2 to the belted tone of a F4. And my head register would be comfy up to the D#5. 3 years? Sounds to me like you switch briefly into falsetto on the word like in your recorded clip. Because it feels like head voice to me, my falsetto is really thin and feels even more unsuported Head voice, physiologically speaking, does not exist. There is only well-produced falsetto and badly-produced falsetto. And various degrees of lighter modal voice with more head resonance, but that's not what yours sounded like. Yeah head voice is more like that glam rock falsetto shout Definitely start mixing to achieve a clearer sound! And don't use head voice down to E3, either use a mix or just chest voice, you'll achieve a better clarity and strength of tone while retaining the lightness and agility. It'll help you reduce the scratchiness of your midrange as well, because a balanced vocal coordination is much better than exclusively using chest or head. Your voice sounds quite light actually. You're not singing too thickly. The main problem I hear from you is that you aren't familiar with the center of your voice - the volume and tone it works most efficiently in - and that's throwing your entire voice off. You need to be able to sing at a medium loud volume with a clear tone first - you have to be intimately familiar with that center volume and tone of your voice, before you can control and vary it effectively. In this file you're only singing at a medium soft volume and it's too breathy. You are already off center in two areas so if this is your default singing voice everything will be hard to control. I'm a baritone and here's a example of roughly how my voice sounds when I'm singing in the center of it. The verses are pretty dead on in the center here, the choruses are fairly close too. That kind of intensity and clarity and balanced tone is the same voice you would start doing vocal exercises in, building your fundamentals etc. Most pro singers hang around the the center of their voice too, though a great many don't (usually by choice not by weakness), so you have to be careful who you imitate. If you're really interested in sorting your struggles out once and for all I'd be happy to give you a free skype lesson to guide you through all of this so you're not just reading words but directly experiencing positive changes in your voice and learning how to control your volume very well"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I literally need a folder for all the videos and a way to play them back and that's about it.

Anyone have a recommendation for a distribution to try? Try Lubuntu. LXDE is the lightest DE without going bare bones (fluxbox, fvwm2, twm). I just installed it and it seems to be fast and responsive. I think Ubuntu went a little overboard with the animations, which really didn't help my performance. As you can see from [this list](https://renewablepcs.wordpress.com/about-linux/kde-gnome-or-xfce/), Unity (which is what Ubuntu uses by default) requires a lot more resources compared to LXDE. I use Peppermint on my 2011 Netbook. It feels faster than Lubuntu to me. Lubuntu might answer the mail for you. Puppy, Lubuntu, Peppermint Tiny Core will boot on anything with 48mb of Ram and an x86 chip, i think. Basically anything made since the 90s. If you need it, there is a Micro Core version that needs even less ram. /r/crunchbangplusplus/ Bunsen Labs Yet I've heard others say the opposite. What are your reasons? Lubuntu/Trisquel Mini is light, Ubuntu MATE/Trisquel might just work, and Bunsen Labs will work pretty well. you should try an older version of you choosen distribution. if you are an ubuntu user, try debian (since ubuntu is i was having the same problem w/ an old laptop. solved it installing an older debian version (wheezy). arch is a great distribution, too. but i used it for a short time. don't forget to compare your hardware with the hardware pre-requisites for the choosen distribution. newer distributions don't adopt well in older hardware. again, keep an eye in older versions of the distribution.

Subreddit: baseball See if you can guess offhand the first year two expansion teams (i.e. started in 1961 or later) played each other in the World Series. And the streak will continue this year: the four remaining AL teams (the Yankees, Orioles, Tigers and A's) were all in the original 16 teams who comprised MLB from the first decade of the century into the 1960's. I've always been amazed at this factoid, and amazed again every year when it continues. The Mets and Astros (Colt .45s) were added in 1962 in the National League, so until 1969, this scenario still had a zero percent chance of happening because there were no AL expansion teams. From '69 to '76, the chances of it happening in AL were 16% (2/12), and in the NL it was 33% (4/12), for a combined chance of 5.5%. The chances gradually rise as more expansion teams are added, but even today, with half of the NL as expansion teams under this definition (NYM, HOU, MIL, WSH, SDP, COL, MIA, ARZ), the combined chance is still just over 14%. All things being equal, it probably *should* have happened by now, but considering that expansion teams are historically weak for a long period of time following their inception - though this has been mitigated somewhat by free agency - this makes it an interesting factoid but not really one that should amaze. I'm still going to be amazed: even if there had been a 14% chance only for the past ten years, it would be 88% likely (rough estimate -- (1-0.14) to the tenth power) to have happened at least once. And that's just for the last decade. I see your point, but I still find it amazing that so many expansion teams have gone to the World Series in both leagues, just never at the same time. Just offhand, the Mets, Diamondbacks, Angels, and Marlins all went to the World Series in consecutive years, but every time they faced an original team. Crazy that it worked out that way every time. Technically the Angels don't meet your criteria, as they began play in 1961. I believe they are considered an expansion franchise. My mistake, I was going off memory. With a soft cap not all teams are equal. I was trying to take a look at whether being an expansion or original team correlates with how they spend, but I ran out of patience. You might be on to something though, the only 3 I can think of that consistently spend a lot on payroll are LAA, Texas, and NYM. I can see how you've forgotten about the Red Sox after the year they had, but they've been historically big spenders too. But the Red Sox were an original team, not an expansion. I am an idiot. I thought he was just talking about high-spending teams. Toronto used to in the early 90's but they're spending like a small market team now. It's frustrating. until 1969, this scenario still had a zero percent chance of happening because there were no AL expansion teams From '62 to '68, the scenario could have happened with Houston or the Mets facing Washington or the Angels. the combined chance is still just over 14% Could you show your math? I get 21.4%. The original post said teams that were added in '62 or later (OP edited it later), so the Angels and Rangers were not included in my math. Thus from '62 to '68, no AL teams qualified. If you add the Angels and Rangers in, the current probability does indeed rise to 21.4%. I don't like that factoid has come to mean a trivial fact.  It originally meant an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print. Sounds like factoid was a predecessor to truthiness. Do you have a citation for that? Does [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/factoid) count? How about [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/factoid)? He's making a joke. So is nowin [deleted] Actually, the Brewers originated in [some Northwestern city in 1969](http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/SEP/1969.shtml) before moving to Milwaukee for good in 1970. They're different teams. Milwaukee moved to St. Louis in the first decade of the 20th century, and then St. Louis moved to Baltimore in the 50's. When the entirely different Seattle Pilots moved after the 1969 season, they adopted the old team's nickname. That practice isn't unusual, either; to confuse this some more, the New York Highlanders (now Yankees) moved up from Baltimore, where they were called ... the Orioles! Finally, through an odd coincidence, when the NBA's Cincinnati Royals had to move, they wound up going to Kansas City. To avoid confusion with the existing MLB team, they renamed themselves the Kings. Did some goofing around on baseball-reference after reading this, came to find that not a single expansion team has an all-time winning record: http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/. The DBacks and Angels are pretty close, each just 10 games below .500. I assume this is regular-season records only, but I'm not positive. Also fascinating is that the Braves only pulled themselves over .500 as a franchise last year. That's pretty impressive when you think about the fact that the Cubs have done nothing to help the NL's chances of getting an original 16 team into the World Series during that time. Interesting I can't seem to find any significance in this. And the Yankees were originally the Orioles way back when. There's always next year. Given the few number of expansion teams and the fact that they take years to be good, and none are power franchises, this isn't remotely interesting or unexpected."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I would hate to lose him, I think he deserves a lot of credit in Teddy's development. Not only as the QB coach but also as the main offensive coach on the sideline. Scott's being groomed to take over the OC position in MN after Norv retires. Norv is 62 years old and I'm sure he'll want to call it a career after a couple more seasons. That would be fantastic to me. Let Scott be the OC, but retain Norv in a less stressful assistant/consultant position. We'll lose him eventually, but I doubt it's this year. Teddys successs has gone under the radar for most of the season. As much as we hate it, the owners watch ESPN as much as the rest of us. Hype tends to hire NFL coaches, not logic and reason. Hopefully they don't watch the fox halftime show. Not every owner is Jerry Jones. I think a lot of GMs have noticed what Teddy has accomplished for a rookie, even if ESPN hasn't. I think we keep him for another year and if someone comes calling we may have to up his salary. I cannot stress enough how important is for a young QB to have continuity in their development. You look at so many guys that had all the talent in the world and then had to learn new systems or work with new coaches and that always ends in failure. We need to keep the program in place that has seen Teddy grow so much in such a few weeks. Scott Turner's first year coaching with his dad was last year in Cleveland, where he coached the WRs, so he hasn't really been following his dad around. I doubt he'll get an OC job this year. While the year Teddy is having looks good on his resume, Teddy isn't completely developed yet. I think NFL owners and GMs understand that. Our offense hasn't been doing all that well this year, either. They'll go after someone they've actually heard of and who has actually helped to develop a good QB more * completely* before going for Scott Turner. Someone who maybe coached Luck or Tannehill or Stafford this year, or someone who worked under someone who coached one of the top offenses this year. I also think he'd like to stay on to coach Teddy to make his resume look even better. I'm sure he'll start garnering more attention in the next couple of years. *lose, not loose. Scott and Teddy are low key bff's I doubt it's this year, but eventually he'll be an OC, but it may be that he's just waiting for his dad to retire and be in position to take over. That would be the smoothest transition for everyone involved. I'm sure Scott would prefer to not have to rebuild a whole scheme so there's obviously an incentive to stay with his dad even if it means less money right now. I'm far more concerned about us losing our DB coach to a DC position than losing Scott."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Have a pump pump water from your water source, store it in an underground store reservoir and connect that to your well. Also, put a door on your well room. My reservoir overflowed and splattered mud all across my marble fortress. If the magma plan fails (in other words, if I still have a running fortress after that) then I'll have to try doing this. Draining or pumping out the water seems like a very good idea over the magma piping. Although, I would love to try making the magma plan work. In the beginning it does not. The water needs to be in an inside tile to avoid the weather http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2012:Tile_attributes Just building a roof over a water source won't prevent it from freezing. Piping magma underneath will unfreeze it, then you could drain it off to an underground cistern. Once it is underground it won't freeze again unless it touches a natural ice wall. Or you could dig down to the caverns, since they frequently have water. Magma works well, but you'll get some continuous freezing/unfreezing of the tiles if I remember correctly, which could lead to some frosty dwarfs if they try to path over it. You could actually skip the whole magma defrosting method if you drain off that pond to an underground cistern while it isn't frozen. You could be lucky and hit water directly below your hospital in the caverns, you'll have to have a 1x1 tunnel all the way to it and build a well on top of that, so the well is directly above water (no matter how many layers are in between) I know I'm dumb, but do you mind telling me how to build vertical tunnels? Do you need to channel down next to a parallel staircase or something? Yeah, channeling down right next to a staircase would work. If you're feeling lucky you can also skip the staircase and just channel down and hope your dwarf will finish all the way to the bottom before he realizes he is stuck. This is how I solved the frozen river problem, pretty quick to setup. I like to have a large res. The water shouldn't get stale because it's constantly refreshed by the river. Magma one level under the pool will keep it from freezing. I had a frozen volcano embark that used this to fill the moat and keep the water flowing. It was a glorious map.

Subreddit: electricians http://imgur.com/a/5mbEf my little oven died a couple days ago, so i opened it up to see if i could work out why. seems the timer switch wasn't working. i took the switch out, there is something rattling around inside it i then just taped the two contacts together, and the oven works. bottom left of second and last pics. logically there is no magic going on in the switch, it's just a spring-loaded timer which mechanically moves the contacts together when it pings off. i am looking at how easy it is to get a new switch. there are other on/off switches controlling the hot plates and oven functions which work fine. aside from the obvious bad safety of the oven not having a timed 'off', which i am wondering how to sort out, is there anything in the wiring simply bypassing the timed switch that is an issue? i'm thinking that there is a risk of the contacts coming clear and touching the frame of the oven. is there a way to steady them safely? if this is facepalmingly bad, i just want to make bread and coffee. the oven itself was provided by the landlords and is worth like $150 max. i'm most certainly not an electrician, obviously. If it's only two wires for the timer, then just connect them as you have, put a wire nut on them (or something appropriately similar) and if you really aren't sure about that connection, you can then also wrap electrical tape around that. it's just the two wires. they sit together quite well because the contacts which used to be connected to the switch lock on to each other. will look into bracing them somehow better than tape. Twisting a wire together and taping it probably isn't the best way to do that. Wire nuts would make for a better electrical and physical connection. This is not a solution that anyone would stand behind and guarantee, but it probably isn't going to cause a safety problem. You have already identified the main problems with this. it's not apparent from the picture but the wires are physically held together under the tape rather than stripped and twisted -- the two contacts which used to sit on either side of the switch lock together sturdily. i was most concerned about the switch performing some extra function i didn't know about in my very sketchy understanding of the circuit. it's certainly not an optimal solution, i am looking around for a new timer. have seen a few other bits online recommending a simple toggle switch which doesn't really solve anything but might be neater. If the connectors are mechanicaly locked together, then you should be alright. The problem with just taping them is that any slight variation or movement can result in only one or two tiny points of contact between the wires. With such a large amount of current passing through the splice these points will overheat and spark. This could damage/melt off the tape and cause the live conductors to touch the inside of the case or other things. This isn't a problem in your case but the splice might get hot anyways because of the normal operation of the oven. I would put a couple layers of heat shrink tubing on that to make sure the tape can't come off. the splice might get hot anyways because of the normal operation of the oven i mean, it's not all super insulated back there anyway but i could see the tape wearing out over time if it's continually heated. if i can't find a replacement timer easily i'm going to grab a simple on/off switch i think, and/or insulate the connection property. I doubt you can find parts. 50 years ago, I fixed all these things, even toasters and kettles but now they aren't worth even a minimum repair fee. Unless you're in China and it looks more like Australia. You could try an appliance place It's possible to find a double male quick connect or to use two males and a piece of wire but frankly what I could do wouldn't be a lot better than what you did. thanks, i will look into a double male connector and some insulating heat-shrink wrap if i can't find an appropriate switch. the oven has always been a legit piece of cheap crap but it works fine , i use it every day, and it seems ridiculous to throw the whole thing away over a single mechanical fault in a spring-wound timer, especially if i can find and remove the faulty part. Maybe there's a local fixit guy? You could ask him. i'm going to do some looking around on monday. the closest i know to a local electrical fixit person is a place nearby that does music equipment repairs (amps, keyboard etc).. might swing by and ask them."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I'm wondering if you guys have any thoughts for how to reliably set your own character on fire. You could use a cloak of flame, causing there to be some phsyical damage taken as fire. with mokus, you then get ignited fairly frequently, in theory. ~~Add in the Shackles of the Wretched and Punishment and Edited per Morokal's correction. you can't ignite yourself with reflect. However, I tested with cloak of flame and mokus and that combo works well for keepign yoruself ignited. Cloak of Flame + dual Mokous is quite fun for levelling. The whole set is quite cheap so it's a great way to get friends started. Also, those pieces alone can keep you capped on fire res well into cruel. Fun exercise: Read some post topics in /r/pathofexile while pretending not to be a gamer. [Cloak of Flame](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Cloak_of_Flame) Makes 25% of the physical damage you take turn into Fire Damage. So anytime a mob lands a Critical strike on you with physical damage, you get ignited. You could also use [Shackles of the Wretched](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Shackles_of_the_Wretched) and curse yourself with Flammability. Then All physical damage would have a 10% chance to ignite you regardless of if they crit or not. However, you would need really high over capped fire resist for this to work. So I didn't really realize mokous embrace gave you a 25% chance to be ignited. So throw the shackles of the wretched idea out the window. All you would need is cloak of flame. And you would be ignited quite often. You can still use shackles to get Punishment on yourself, which causes phys reflect to turn into fire hits to ignite as well. That may be a bit overboard though. Shackles + Assassin's Mark for extra chance to be crit! just triple curse , np Cursing yourself with temp chains would increase the time you are ignited, but it might be annoying to play. Although it would enable you to have 100% uptime Immortal Call too This question alarmed and confused me till I saw it was from the PoE subreddit. Does anyone know if it would work with Righteous Fire? figured it worked like stuns, it did not. The lower your resist does not equal a higher chance to be ignited. It would just make you take more fire damage if you were by chance ignited.

Some of the best, pure, most atmospheric scenes of BtVS are in the first 3 seasons. Continuity was irrelevant. Well, I mean the reason it's not explored is because it serves no purpose to the plot. In terms of screen-time, there's just no point going into that area. It's not that the families of people killed by demons/mummy's etc etc wouldn't have chased it up, it's just a waste of time to go into it when you've got 40 minutes.

Gru left because he saw that Cordelia and Angel were in love and he was in the way of them being together. But it doesnt seem right But where did Gru go? Did he hop the next portal home? Did he stay in LA where he knew no one, had no money and no ID? They could have thrown in a quick line about what happened, especially since he, Cordie and Angel all disappeared the same night. I think that's sort of explored in the comics. But yeah, the show never addressed it. He appears in After the Fall Huh assuming he just took off into the sunset, but the fact that no one wondered where he went is strange..and why didnt gunn or fred question if maybe he and cordelia just took off together, or if he had something to do with their disappearances.. That's always bugged me. I know he was just a plot point to keep Cordie and Angel from banging, but I've always wondered what happened to him. I personally would have been more than happy to take him. Maybe he became a demon hunter. What's a rogue demon? Yeah, Angel and Cordy both went missing that night, and presumably Fred and Gunn didn't know that Gru was leaving, so they should have questioned his disappearance as well. Gru is in Angel: after the fall. He helps Angel and co fight after [SPOILER] Los Angeles is sent to hell by the Senior Partners.

And [here](http://sayrith.tumblr.com/#16998635405) and [here](http://sayrith.tumblr.com/#16996264030) are some examples of mine So all of you fine chaps, what do you think of HDR? It has it's place, much the same as any other technique. Of the two examples you gave though, one has really obvious movement in the sky and ghosting around the buildings and the other has suffered with chromatic aberrations. Check out stuck in customs. I dont get why people dont like that. It looks cool. do you mean when edges have sort of a glow to them? I looked again and see very clear green/blue edges on one side and orangey/red edges on another, which does not look good at all For the ghosting, you need to line up your images better in processing, and not use a background that's moving heavily like those clouds. I'm not sure where the CA is coming from - perhaps your source images have a bit and it's being amplified in the HDR processing? If that's the case, you need to remove it first The ghosting occurs when you take and later combine multiple frames which are not perfectly aligned, which often happens to handheld shots. This effect is quite visible in the clouds and edges of buildings. The glow effect you described is known as haloing, and usually occurs during the tone-mapping process where there is a solid color like the sky. Some people try to remove the halo while others leave it in there for stylistic effect. I think HDR has its place when there are extreme levels of light across the frame and you run up again the dynamic range limitations of whatever equipment you are using. The shots you linked to are probably not the best examples, since there is ghosting (did you take multiple frames hand-held?) and you've actually destroyed information with the oversat sunset. I think HDR done well can bring more clarity to a shot, not less, because it can reveal a little more shadow detail and stop the highlights from blowing out. I think it's also important to make sure that composition of the shot has merit enough without the effect. For instance, you probably should have framed your first example differently so that the bottom left grill sign was all shown. Well, partly that, you've managed to it it two different ways on each photo. why do people not like that glow? Isnt it obvious that I am going for a stylized effect rather than using HDR for correction? Which glow? The ghosting or CA? If you mean the CA you weren't going for that effect it just happened. If you mean the ghosting well if you intended for the camera to move between frames and the clouds to appear obviously to have moved then OK, you achieved the desired effect."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

They did fix this for Windows 8, but the SKUs for 7 are different and the keys are not cross compatible. I assume since you don't have a DVD you are using an OEM key and this is a potential problem. Well it says Windows 7 Home Premium OA then 2 bar codes, then a 25-digit product key. It came pre-installed with 32-bit however I went and rechecked some at Microsofts support site and I found a few posts that said the product keys should work for 32 or 64 bit, I may have been thinking of initial release 7 keys or something. In that case the key should hopefully be usable for 64 bit, though you may have to call support to activate it, because OEM keys don't seem to internet activate for me very frequently (because the OEM activates it manually when installing it). The key is for 32 and 64 bit. If you have an official key you may be able to contact Microsoft about getting an ISO which you can burn to a disc. I'm assuming that your are using Windows 7 32-bit currently, and want to change to 64-bit? If that's the case, then I'm afraid that isn't possible.

Subreddit: fantasyfootball Help me settle an argument between a buddy and I. We have had a fantasy league going on 4 years now. Of those 4 years I have won twice and been second place once. The 4th year(this year), I'm currently in a tie for first. Additionally I have led the league in points for two of those years while also having at least the second most points scored against in every completed season. By buddy says that the reason I have won is because I'm 'lucky and that's the difference between him and I. He has only been second place once in our league and got help from the least points scored against him to help him win many of those games. I kind of took the lucky comment as a personal insult. I spend a fair amount of time researching my team every week and put a lot of thought into it with good success. So can anyone actually be good at fantasy to where you are successful year after year, or can a lot of success just come down to dumb luck? m ranting and need help settling an argument. All skill Don't judge someones performance on one week or even one season. After 3 seasons of playing with someone you will know whether they are skilled or lucky. Appreciate your haters. Let the results speak for themselves. It's a lot of both, if you do your homework and are making moves to make your team better you increase your chances of winning. A lot if it is luck, as well. It's almost impossible to predict what a certain player is going to do in any given Sunday. Who would've though jamaal Charles would put up 40 pts on NO, who would've thought Brian Hartline would put up 245yds + a TD with a rookie QB. For him to say you're just lucky, though, is just jealousy. In my 4 years of ff I've never won, but by all means I do not think I am bad at the game, I'm just unlucky when I need to be lucky. Its skill up until injuries happen. I have won last year and came in second the 2 years before that. m kind of lucky avoiding injuries the last 3 years but this year im dead last and its cause all of my guys and playing bad or injured. If you have a top scoring team and you are constantly shifting around your starters / bench, odds are its skill. Why are you letting what he says get to you? Who cares what he thinks if the end result seems to be you winning consistently. If everyone in a league knows a decent amount about football, then it's mostly luck imo. Like this year, for example, someone who drafted Amendola as a sleeper is celebrating whereas someone who took Ryan Williams over him got screwed. Don't forget schedules I say having lucky DAYS is part of it (ie: Hartline and 253 yards), but to have a strong full SEASON or multiple years (if you're in a keeper league), making strong trades, knowing who to grab on WW and who is worth passing on, is all skill. Playing fantasy is like being the GM of a team in real life. The moves you make affect the product you put on the field. If you can acquire the best players and put them on the field (metaphorically speaking), then you're giving yourself the best shot, even on a day when you may not be so lucky. It takes skill to put yourself in a position to be lucky. Honestly, it's a lot like poker. Anyone can beat anyone in one hand/one game, but over time, luck plays less and less of a role. Over time, everyone ends up getting lucky sometimes, and unlucky other times, and skill becomes the deciding factor. If it's any indication, the US government just ruled that poker is a game of skill, not luck.

Subreddit: devops I am keen to know the following from the community: How many sysadmins out there are using Puppet to deploy applications which are primarily source code? (The source code could be in zip file or tar ball format) Would you still advocate Puppet If it is not as simple as repackaging the the zip/tar file to a native package (i.e: rpm) and restarting the service upon installation due to custom scripts/commands that need to be run prior to restarting a service? I've done it before but forcing shell-script style linear deploy processes from the developer tends to make the Puppet manifests look odd. This deployment process is a trick question - I wouldn't advocate any configuration management system in general that's declarative and idempotent first when deploying most linear deployment patterns. You avoid less uncertainty and brittleness in your system due to weirdo issues that happen from using Puppet, Chef, or even Ansible by sticking with native packages first-most as your atomic unit of software deployment. Software deployments are typically workflows that, while we'd like to treat declaratively, is pretty complicated oftentimes architecturally that necessitate linear workflows instead of end-state definitions due to repeatability of the process being required too. Trying to use configuration management software to perform workflows is the equivalent of using digraph data structures to store just linked lists. You can do it, but you're probably making it more complicated than it should be and probably losing some efficiency to shoehorn something into the wrong mental model. I have used Puppet and Ansible to deploy code and it has always felt a little dirty. Have you thought about packaging the code up. This would allow you to use the standard providers within Puppet whether that be rpm, deb or whatever the distro you are using likes. If you have a CI process you can make the packaging and extra step in the release process. Most of what you're looking for can be accomplished by properly packaging your software. If there are scripts that need to be run you could probably put them into your rpm/deb package. I used puppet (non commercial) heavily in my last job. I would still recommend Puppet if you have to push out binaries (or pull them! puppet could run commands to wget/curl/carrier-pigeon-fetch your artifacts. That said, use what will get you going the fastest for your env., whether puppet, puppet-enterprise, Ansible, Chef, or SaltStack We've hit some roadblocks that actually kind of makes Puppet a pain for software deployments. Our applications tend to require a little bit of orchestration to get properly set up (interact with load balancers, rolling deploy, managing communication from other apps, things of that nature), and we have to be able to run puppet on a machine without kicking off a code deploy. We're actually looking into using Puppet to enforce state every hour or so, and using Ansible for code *just* posted on my [blog](https://dmsimard.com/2015/03/14/harness-the-power-of-puppetdb-with-ansible-dynamic-inventory/) about using Ansible with Puppet. Which is a great idea. puppet should not be considered an orchestration tool. you use stuff like ansible, mcollective or salt for that (salt can also do configuration management) Puppet just doesn't handle orchestration particularly well. The company I work for has done a pretty good job forcing a square through a round hole, but it's going to be awesome once we move to something more maintainable. The exciting thing about marrying the two is puppet allows you to make assumptions about your environment. You can assume an application or environment is pre-setup, and really have Ansible only target the changes you need to make. Also, although I'm not using it at my current gig, I'm a *huge* salt fanboy. Fantastic post that actually details exactly where I want to end up. This is exactly what I'm thinking; the roadblocks you hit when you try to force Puppet to do complex application deployments. Puppet is declarative. Ensure RPM foo is installed is easy with Puppet. Extract tarball to wherever. Run this instaler.  None of those are declarative tasks. Puppet is not the ideal choice if you're unwilling to create a package. The upside is that creating a package is actually pretty simple. Specfiles aren't hard, help automate your build process, and rarely need to be modified if created correctly. A tool like FPM can create a package from a tarball, no problem. A tool like Omnibus (from the Chef guys) can automate the creation of self-contained installers for multiple platforms. With all of that said, Puppet is great for baselining, but somewhat weak for orchistration. If your upgrade process requires a lot of systems be upgraded in a specific order (high probability of being true if you have to worry about database schema updates...) then you probably want an orchistration tool like Ansible rather than a config management tool like Puppet. If your main concern is establishing service relationships, then the best tool for the job is going to be a service discovery tool like etcd/confd or Consul. Service discovery can be used with CFM or Orchestration easily enough, based on your needs. Many companies I know use Puppet for config and Ansible for deployment. That's mostly because Ansible came out more recently. I would recommend using Ansiblr for everything. It's great for code deploys, orchestration and smoke testing. I am currently in the process of reworking our infrastructure and one thing I plan to tackle is the code deploy. We currently tag code in Github and that tarball is pulled, extracted, placed, and configured. I think the approach I plan to take is building an RPM for each release tag that is created and using something like Ansible or Puppet to handle the installation of it. As my question suggests if its a matter of just installing the package and restarting the service, then its fine. However, if there are intermediary steps as I've highlighted you will most likely have to come up with adhoc ways to get around it. I've gotten around this using expect scripts and then fpm to create rpms which are then pushed into our local repo and installed via puppet. We do deploy code straight from git using vcsrepo and this works pretty well. On the other hand we have some nightmare stories of chained execs and dodgy batch scripts used in puppet to deploy python code that I wouldn't put anyone through. If it's fairly complex code, I would look into something that is actually made to deploy code like Fabric or Capistrano. I use ansible now instead. It's puppet with none of puppet's headaches."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

So I looked into tips, tried the ladder technique, got him 3 times, one more should do it... pinned against foot of ladder when i jump off him, one shotted. Also, if you die a second time, do your souls from the last death disappear FOREVER? It's going to slowly drive me insane Oh also, what's the weird crystal slug thing that comes out of the barrels next to the white light to the Taurus demon bridge? Yep, if you die again your souls are gone. It sounds as though you need to level up your character or gear before you tackle Taurus again. But where do I get more armour? I'm a knight, and there doesn't seem to be any merchants in Firelink Shrine. Your main source of armour will be through drops and finds. The merchant in the undead burg is to the right and down the stairs just before the undead burg bonfire. Your knight armor is good for quite some time. You can find elite knight armor in the forest, and it can last you a long time too. He's weak to lightning and fire. It's possible to find 3 gold pine resins in the Burg, you might have needed to start with the master key. Firebomb spam is also a legit strategy. There's a really strong 2-handed sword in the graveyard if you can get it and run, it will kill him in 2 falling attacks I think. I was lucky enough to get the black knight sword on my first playthrough, killed him with ease. Second playthrough, it took me ~6 falling attacks with pro dodge rolls to kill him. Sadly, not a mage. Although I'll have a look for that sword, I mean I should be able to get through with my knight. You don't need to be a mage, gold pine resin coats your sword in lightning for ~60 seconds. Firebombs are little throwables you can buy from the merchant in the Burg. Er, well I don't have the master key, and apparently all my firebombs vanished when I died. I'll have to spam the entrance to the burg. Don't need a master key for the gold pine resin in undead burg. Visit the merchant you were informed of and you should understand. You'll need the Residence key from that merchant, then you'll be able to open all doors within the Burg. Is there a way to find out what an enemy is weak against other than trail and error? Using the wiki is how I found out. Most organic-type enemies are weak to bleed, and lots of things are weak to lightning. I try to stay away from hints and tips as its still my first run. Not that I'm successful with it. So the jump off the top tatic does work, I had a hard time because I found that I wasn't running far enough down the bridge before I turned around. This is so you can gain the space you need to get up the ladder safely. Ah, for me I just keep getting caught on his legs while diving. once there, run back to the other side and climb the ladder, jump off and attack him. Don't jack around on the tower too long or he will jump up there with you. the weird crystal thing is a Lizard. if you can get to it and kill it in time before it disappears, it will drop a Twinkling Titanite. I just get stuck trying to roll round/between his legs or he turns as i roll through his legs, and I get one-shotted off the bridge. so you encounter, fight a bit and get backed up where you feel you need some breathing room to fight and need to get by him right? if so I think I had the same issue as you once or twice. Take off the target lock and then run past, turn around and target again. You are good for another bout until he backs you up again. If you try and run/roll past with the target lock on you get screwed because you can't get enough open space between the two of you in the amount of time needed to not get hit. Well, ok I'm sure better players can do it with ease, but the easy way is to off target lock for a moment. He has 4 chances to kill me now, not 2. I am new to the game and did the same build with Deprived. Took him out without using the pine sap. Just used a few firebombs and learned the attack patterns after the demon killing me like 5 or more times. Let him take a big swing thwomp at you, miss, then go in and give him one yourself and then get the hell out of range, repeat. He will eventually back you up to the wall area. Before you are trapped against it and stuck, think about that running by tactic to keep the battle going, let him take a big swipe and miss, off target and full on sprint by. Because if you get trapped up against one of the walls it may be your demise. I'll try that tactic, but use one of the pines just to speed it all up.

I guess they just don't feel the need to play to a single winner. It's mainly because with 200 people, 3 rounds takes around 4 hours (including deck construction). Also they run 6-7 prerelease events, so that factors into the time restraints. We had a 7 round prerelease too. It's good practice for GPs and it lets me see how my deck perform at its best and at its worst and against different strategies. Can be very educational. Our midnight pre-release was 7 rounds. Went until about 9AM. There was then an 11AM pre-release that some people went to... Those people are insane. I think if I'm going to a pre-release I wanna play with my deck as much as possible! My LGS often has 7 round pre releases because all the people who went to the midnight pre-release and have a better idea of the format come to the day time release too. my first pre-releases) we only had 4-5 rounds, so I got into that.

We had 7-8 rounds in KTK and I had a grindy Abzan that almost always went to turns so I was exhausted and making stupid plays by the end i dont have a sideboard, Q: What was the outcome of each match, in order? This may be over-thinking, I realize, but I've generally found that I'm happier losing match 1 because it means I'll be playing up the rest of the night. If I win match 1 I'll be in the top half (at least) and then after that I'll be fighting other undefeated players. So, if you went 4 wins in a row you'd go into match 5 against another undefeated. If you had your 3 losses first you'd be more likely to play others who aren't doing too well, which depending on your skill level and pool, could be an advantage. All of that is pretty irrelevant though, the more people at an event, the more matches played, there's a huge amount of variation based on how pairings are made, etc. To say If I played John instead of Mike I would have won is an unknowable thing. I guess I'm just basing my comment on player experience. Newer players don't have the mastery that experienced players do. Experienced players will make their way up the ranks while newer players may have a few wins but usually end up in the middle of the rankings or below. it means you avoid the undefeated folks and have a chance for a come from behind decent record. Back in RTR block it felt like if I won match 1 I would be playing against some crazy fast Boros deck and lose within 10 minutes. I have no problem losing match 1 and then having more variety in player experience and deck style the rest of the event. Plus, I'm only down a pack if I come in 3rd or 4th usually. the guy i lost to in the final round wound up in 13th place before the single elimination began So how many rounds total were played? You must have had a lot of people. My LGS never gets to elimination matches but some people will drop early or the undefeated players will sometimes split. i didnt stick around to the end but the swiss was 7 rounds, then top 16 went to single elimination. between each round, the option to split is presented to the remaining players but unless they unanimously vote to split they keep going. maximum of 11 rounds, i believe that's a lot of players. pool is huge, too - THS went to top 2 before they could split and both players got, like, 2 boxes I came in 4/30 at midnight and today I went 3/14.

Justice League Then I opened my *very first* booster pack, got Cyborg  Expectionally I checked it against the checklist that came with the set, and his card says Exceptionally Gifted, so I know it's a typo. Maybe I'm just too much of a grammar/spelling nazi but these mistakes just irritate me. Is WizKids developing these sets so stupidly fast that they have no time for quality control or something? Maybe I should lower my standards, but this is pretty disappointing, honestly. At this point, I'm upset every single set seems to have some form of error and won't expect much from Wizkids anymore. Don't even get me started on the art work for the yugioh cards, literally looks like they took a picture off of their TV screens while watching the show. I love the way the game's playing, and how popular it is in my area, but at the same damn time, it feels like if they're delaying the set for a month and a half, they should have their stuff sorted out. Don't quote me, but I've speculated that the TV screenshots for Yugioh is probably related to Konami's holding the card game, so they probably weren't able to just use the card art. Doesn't really excuse the low quality, but hey, it's something. They were only allowed to use what Konami let them use. They're a small company, so I'm sure they're not paying someone enough to proof read, or if they are, it's not their main job. Combine that with trying to ship sets as fast as possible, and you get errors like these. At least the dice/card quality is pretty good for this set. Only had 1 pack out of 90 where the cards were stuck together, and just one character's die is terrible(Captain Cold). Jeez, I'll proof-read their cards and text for *free I think they need to stop the money grab by pumping out a new set every couple months, and work on quality a bit. But of course, that won't happen. Money talks. It does seem like a wider playtest group could help catch those errors. Trust me guys, they've been getting better. There is a long list of characters with poor and inconsistent wording (both grammatically and mechanically), and a few spelling mistakes. Hopefully as the game continues they'll eventually get to a good professional quality in ALL aspects of execution. I just opened Black Canary - Crime Fighter and it is marked with a green stripe for an uncommon with #77 of 138. The expansion pack checklist that came with my starter has her listed under common and numbered as #39. Which is misprinted the list or the card? If it is the list, then Black Canary is the only character with a super-rare in the DC set that has an uncommon rarity type as one of their choices. Does the distribution in the pack reflect the common or uncommon expectancy rate? At least, I now know why the numbers were not lining up when I started filling in the blank spaces last week on said checklist. And not only the typos, but how about some of the image selections as well? The Wonder Woman choice is HORRIBLE Wonder Woman is the cover of #1 from her New 52 series, and it was a critically acclaimed series. It's not surprising that they'd use something that well-known.

Does anyone have any experiences with either of these programs you could share? My opinion is that they are both excellent programs, but they seem pretty different. Simmons has small classes and a very personal feel, while BU has better research faculties, more faculty, and is higher ranked. They seem to have pretty comparable clinical offerings. I haven't been able to visit either school because I am currently volunteering abroad and won't return to the US before I need to make my decision, so I am having a really hard time getting a feel for either one. Any insights you can give me on quality of education, reputation, atmosphere, your experiences ect would be very much appreciated! who has the higher pass rate for first time test takers? who will cost less? this is all that really matters. in the end.... you will still be a DPT no matter where you go, but the licensure pass rate is THE biggest question, not who has the better research facilities Both programs will cost about the same due to the scholarships I have been offered (both will be about $65,000 for the 3 years) so fortuantely I do not have to consider cost much. The 3 year average pass rate for Simmons (2009-2011) was 90%, while BU's pass rate over the past 5 years is 99.5%. Until you posted this I hadn't paid a whole lot of attention to that difference, so I really apprecaite you pointing that out. in the end all that matters is that you pass the licensure exam. Look carefully at that statistic. Programs may post a number of outcomes. There is a difference between first-time pass rate (i.e. how many grads pass the NPTE on their first attempt) and three-year overall pass rate (i.e. what percentage of grads ultimately pass the exam over a three-year period). The numbers that you cite above look like apples and oranges to me. you can't miss with either program. They both have quite a good reputation. The advice that I give to applicants is find a program that is the best fit for you. What are the class sizes like? What is the Program's mission, and does it speak to you? Is the curriculum/teaching-learning model up your alley (e.g. problem-based vs. more traditional)? Simmons averaged 3 years (90%) and BU averaged 5 years (99.5%), but they are both reflective of average 1st time passing rates. They both report 100% overall passing rates after taking account people who take the test more than once. Correct me if I'm wrong though, because I am doing all of this research using internet in west Africa and webpages never load correctly- I could be seeing things incorrectly. 3rd year DPT student from Massachusetts here. Last I heard Simmons had run into some troubles by CAPTE, the accrediting body for PT doctorate programs. Just something to do some research into. thats a great point. I spoke with a current student at Simmons and she told me that they were on accreditation probation due to a lack of reasearch being published by faculty. They have since added research labs and more profs with PhDs, and they have been re-accredited. This is soemthing that concerns me a bit even though they have resolved the issue, because I worry that it may have affected the reputation of the program. Do you feel, as a PT student in Mass, that this has affected their reputation? I am currently a senior at BU in the AT/DPT program, so currently a first year PT student. I don't really know much about the Simmons program, but BU's program is great. The professors are all wonderful and want to help you become the best clinician you can be. The class sizes are somewhat large, but there are always plenty of TA's in the lab to give plenty of 1 on 1 help if you need it. Also, BU in general is a great place.

Just trying to find out more info about this rucksack I looked around for reviews too when I saw this on Massdrop. Didn't find any. I took a chance and joined the drop for the Alpine Green rucksack. Most of my reluctance is because sometimes unknown brands inflate their retail prices on their websites to let deal sites list a price that looks like a great sale price. But I'll take a risk on this and see how it turns out, since I don't currently own any nicer backpacks/bags. Between this and Duluth Pack's bags, I like this rucksack's design more. Did you end up liking this bag? Wondering if I should take the plunge on massdrop. I did like the bag--I ended up buying it for my girlfriend instead of myself, though. The material feels really sturdy and thick, and the backpack indeed looks very good in person. It's very much a type of possession that you'd enjoy touching and wearing and admiring months after purchasing. The one possible problem with the design is that the leather straps are unpadded and quite scratchy on the inside. I could see it getting uncomfortable if you wore it for a long time, or if you wore it in a tank top or shirtless. The backpack size is roomy and it satisfactorily holds all of my girlfriend's stuff when she comes over to visit. She's a college athlete, so she sometimes has to stuff training clothing and gear into her backpacks and it all fits in the rucksack without problems. It also looks really cute on her. I guess you can take this two ways: I liked the backpack enough to give it to someone very important to me. I now have no continued firsthand experience with the backpack, so I am not to be trusted. It's actually also for my girlfriend, so I'm glad it does well on the looks cute on girlfriend in 3 months (the cons of massdrops) I've read some reviews on their other products and it seems to be very positive. I've never heard about the brand before and there's not much about them out there, but they could just be a new brand trying to enter the market (hence the massdrop) Also, I was able to find a deal for the rucksack on some site called [gilt](http://www.gilt.com/brand/british-belt-company/product/1075983322-british-belt-company-langdale-rucksack) which has its own [reputation](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/ yup i saw the same GILT deal, but it's pricier than the current one they are running at massdrop.

I mine peercoin but doge would be a waste of my computing power lol. Peercoin is better than bitcoin? Easier to mine with lesser hardware (sort of) and it solves some of the problems with the bitcoin model by introducing proof of stake. In my opinion, the constant creation and diversification of the coin systems could devolve all the coin markets into people jumping onto the *next big thing* and never propping up one single coin standard and allowing it to stabilize which will prove all the critics correct that it's nothing but speculative investments instead of a currency system.

PG and VG are tough. The vapor is very nice with Max VG but the flavor that the PG carries is too much for me to pass on.

It's great we have a choice in most of our juice blends because honestly sometimes I like to blow clouds. Hmm, most of the max vg flavors I've tried don't seem that short on flavor. Some are pretty good actually flavor wise but it might be because the VG is inherently sweet or that they increase the flavor percents. I'm still learning so I may not be 100% correct. On a side note, I have been playing with super concentrated flavors that only need to be mixed at 1-3% which is really nice because I prefer to vape the least amount of flavoring as possible. Good luck with your DIY, it's been quite the journey for me so far lol. What site do you get these concentrated flavors off of? They have some good flavors there, although lately I've been using a local company(a friend of mine works there) with good results. I don't feel comfortable giving out their name since they aren't ready for general public sale yet. pm if you need any help once you get going Does max VG usually refer to 80% Vg or 100%? A lot of the flavors are carried in PG. So when you add flavor you are adding PG to it as well. Max VG could refer to the maker not adding any extra PG outside the flavors OR it could mean that they are using VG flavors and thinning out the mix with water. 80% VG is a safe bet since most vendors are using about 15-20% flavor in their juices. I make my own juices and when people ask for max vg, I only use vg and flavors. I have a lot of inquiries and interest for my juices I'm about to order all of the stuff I need for diy juice. Well are you looking to get rid of the juice by any choice? Well most are at a quarter or lower, with a few exceptions (cactus flower) so I don't know if it'd be worth shipping. I'll probably just give them out to my friends who vape. Picked up a SVD for a friend a while back, good on you for using BTC as a currency and attributing to it's value. Do you know if the vendors automatically convert it into USD though? I'd love for it to catch on more, but it just seems everyone is trying to ride the speculative bubble. Depends on how they accept it. Places like bitpay can just convert straight to a bank deposit. You would really have to ask, even if they use bitpay they don't necessarily convert, but it's a good indicator. However, they probably need USD to buy new product, so who can blame them? Not blaming them at all. I just don't see how it attributes to the value of bitcoin if it's immediately cashed in for USD. Maybe just by increasing awareness or through the use of bitcoin? Either way I was surprised at how easy and streamlined it was. No dealing with CC numbers, just a quick QR scan and I was good to go.

It doesn't matter when you eat, just that you're eating the right amount. Your goal weight of 45kg would leave you * severely* underweight with a BMI of 15.79. Not just skinny but needs to be hospitalized underweight. The fact that you have a dangerously low goal weight, that you are eating *far* below your BMR (the number of calories your body requires for things like *breathing*), and that you are already at a healthy weight are very worrying. You really need to talk to your doctor about setting reasonable fitness goals and about the possibility that you may be showing signs of disordered eating behavior. 1200 calories/day and 3 hours/week at the gym (ballpark 500 calories/hr) will result in a deficit of about 650 calories/day. That will allow you to lose about 0.6 kg per week. At your starting weight, it's tough to lose much faster than that without losing too much lean body mass. That's still enough to get you to 50 kg in 21 weeks, and it leaves a little bit of room in your calorie limit to allow you an occasional treat of the foods you like, or a couple of drinks on the weekend. This post is extremely worrying. That's a 16% reduction in bodyweight in 21 weeks - less than 1% a weekly (not accounting for weekly adjustments). Doesn't seem unreasonable to me.

This is my first foray into OCR The good news is I get to control the printed medium (font, size, etc.) Any advice, stories, links etc. Tesseract is good It's written in C as far as I know but there are Java bindings for it. I played with it on Android and it works. Need to train it. I've used Tesseract with some success, through Tess4J. The main problem is that you still have to install Tesseract locally in order for Tess4J to work, so if you're making a project you intend to distribute to other users, you'll have to figure out how to package it, which hugely bloats an installation, or convince them to download it locally. Tesseract is quite powerful, though. If you control the printed medium, you can train tesseract to recognize your specific font, which improves its accuracy substantially. Caveat: I did not use it for any high volume or professional tasks, so my limited experience may not be representative. You don't need a complete Tesseract install, you only need the data files (Tess4J bundles the tesseract library). About 12MB zipped for English This does not appear to be the case, at least any more. There were quite a few dependencies needed to get Tess4J running on my dev box. Tesseract is quite powerful, though. If you control the printed medium, you can train tesseract to recognize your specific font, which improves its accuracy substantially. I trained it to recognize OCR-B and now it only recognizes that, everything else is garbage. I use it in a banking application. Does your specific application require 100% accuracy? The application is scanning for OCR-B and from there it scans for a known pattern (like \\d{3}-\\d{9}-\\d{1} where \\d{1} is a checksum. It was very correct (and very well trained) but false positives (numbers) were not an issue of course because of the pattern. Last time I surveyed the landscape, pure Java OCR was like a sasquatch: many claimed to have seen bits of it, but nothing tangible or ready for prime time was available. As others have indicated, the greatest traction seems to be in wrapping Tesseract. There are libraries for doing this, but nothing truly portable. > pure Java OCR was like a sasquatch: many claimed to have seen bits of it, but nothing tangible excellent information transmission. i understand you completely. Good point, I suppose I should have been more clear in that a wrapper is fine as long as I can easily integrate it into a Java app. So far Tess4J seems to be the cleanest approach. I've seen Tesseract used but I have no experience integrating it myself. I've seen it used by executing the process on an image or subset of an image and then the resulting text file was read in by standard Java methods"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

It's a standard mechanical hard drive so it shouldn't be doing any of that compression SSDs do with the /dev/zero pass. Also the dd process was maxing out a single core of my quad core CPU. I have an Intel Core i5 2500K so I wouldn't think my CPU would be a bottleneck here not sure why else it would be maxed. Is there a way to make it utilize more than one core if that's the case? Another thing I was considering was Frandom. Has anyone here used Frandom before? My purpose would be to prep a drive for encryption. If you don't fill a drive with random data, it becomes possible to tell what parts of the drive have data on them based on the theory that it's impossible to tell random data from encrypted data. I know /dev /urandom is probably a better randomizer but will Frandom be good enough for this purpose? My purpose would be to prep a drive for encryption. Fill the drive after encrypting it. So if you're feeding pure zeros to LUKS will it be random enough? I would assume that would be a good bit faster than /dev/urandom especially since my CPU supports AES acceleration. It just seems a bit iffy to me. I'm don't know the fine details of encryption there may be a pattern to emerge if you're feeding LUKS only zeros and nothing else. There's no repeating pattern. Modern ciphers are not vulnerable to [known plaintext attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack). Any pattern it does create would be the same as your actual encrypted data, and /dev/urandom might not be. This is the method actually suggested by the devs of cryptsetup: That's very specific to https. Yes, it will be enough. It doesn't matter what you feed the encryption algorithm, the output will always be indistinguishable from random noise, even if the input is all-zeroes. Oh, and for the record, the reason people zero or random-fill their drives before setting up crypto is so that data previously present on the drive cannot be recovered through forensic methods (although it is questionable whether this is still possible at all with modern disks). badblocks or shred are faster. I usually do shred -vz /dev/sdx. That will do 3 passes of random data and an extra one of zeroes. badblocks Creates a repeating pattern. It's not crypto level random. If that extra pass of zeros is last, it actually defeats the entire purpose. The drive needs to be full of random data when I put encryption on it. Otherwise someone could look at the drive and say OK 10GBs of random data at the beginning of the drive and the rest is 90GBs of zeroes. Now we know where to focus our attack.  Not that I expect anyone to go through all that if my computer gets stolen or whatnot but if you're gonna do something, do it I thought you wanted to wipe the drive. When you wipe a drive to resell or reuse, it makes sense to add an extra pass of zeroes. If your purpose is filling the drive with random data to use it as volume for an encrypted FS, then just don't do the extra pass of zeroes, and do only one pass of random instead of 3 because it don't makes sense to do more than one for that purpose. /sdx is your command.

He/she may have to do a little traveling for interviews, but at the end of the day could line up a fantastic opportunity in an amazing country that has a great standard of living. first of all there are rrequirements and laws pertaining to foreign nationals in most all countries on what they can do... its not as simple as packing up and moving to a country Understood. What if these people happen to be dual citizens? What insight would you give then? Look into the tax laws for the country you are a dual citizen in. Definitely save a nest egg up, and save it with at least a years worth of living expenses before moving anywhere. That way you are covered no matter what happens. Having stuff if nice, living like a king is nice, but I would also consider whether or not you want to completely uproot and live in a different culture. Maybe take a month long trip to the place you are considering, you may not like the culture enough to want to live there full time. This is good thinking. But do some research before you leave. I am a permanent resident and middle class in the US with a decent savings. If I move back to my home country, I would be able to retire immediately and be a upper middle class. Imagine a nice 2 bed room commercial grade apartment rents for 250-300 dollars in the center of a large city and everything is within walking distance. If not, public transportation is so good that you will never ever need a car. The country has the largest high speed railway network. My hometown has subway, Taxi and Uber(yes Uber is there. But it is a problem for my children since they grew up here. I will do that once they are self sufficient. (better benefits, travel, relocation, etc.) I am not an engineer but work in finance / headcount planning for a large company that employees many engineers. An arrangement like you heard about is possible but does not happen that often, in my experience. Especially if you have a job where you can work from anywhere (like your home) already, not much benefit for the company to pay to relocate you to somewhere unless you can make a good business case for how this helps the company (i.e. maybe with a move you would be in the same timezone as other employees who you work with so could be more efficient). Also needs to be in a country where there are limited persons with expertise in your area - otherwise why not just pick up a local to do the work you are doing, but at the lower salary."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I wont name the babies before they are born but I would love a top 4 to consider as I am sort of a person who likes a name one week but not the next. My top name picks that I thought ' Reuben William Thomas Benjamin As I discussed these options with my husband I discovered all the names are the names of his cousins (except for Benjamin which is my nephew). my husband has a rather large and close family network. I like the idea of timeless (traditional) names, a name that will never get weird. My husband also likes the idea of common names that perhaps isn't quite so common any more. He said to me 'Wouldn't it be funny to call a kid Roger?' I hoped that he was joking but the more I think about it, maybe he was serious? I don't care for the 'twinny' sounding names I would like both names to be able to stand independently. Surname rhymes with Koose and we are Australians. The following are some sturdy, traditional names that don't currently appear to be common in Australia based on the data from [this site](https://www.nsw.gov.au/about-nsw/popular-baby-names): Douglas * Neville * Thaddeus funnily enough Neville is my Dads name and my husbands grandfather and cousins name (see what I am up against!) fortunately the name doesn't resonate with me. Nothing really sticks out in the list, some of the names are a bit too out there like Clement and Reginald but names like Trevor and Douglas are more around the mark. I know a little boy Roger, it's unexpectedly cute on him. Frederick Duncan Malcolm James Jeffrey Timothy Benedict Matthew Matthias I'm very visual and I tend to get very overwhelmed when I'm trying to do everything in my head. If you're anything like me, here's my advice - print out the social security list for your country (maybe from last year) and go through and cross off every name that's too closely associated with a family member for you to feel comfortable using. Side note: names like John, William, Thomas, Andrew etc are so widely used that it probably wouldn't be weird to have two in one family. Then, go through and cross off everything you think is strange or sounds bad with your last name or that just isn't your style. Since you're naming two babies instead of just one, it might be easier to have one pool of names to look through instead of lots of different lists in different places. My male twin cousins are named Ruben and Rodney Haha I did think of the name 'Rodney' I really like Reuben (will have to look into spelling) but I love the idea of having a baby nicknamed 'Roo' Rufus or Rupert? I love the nickname roo, but I had to rule out all r names as I tend to 'w' my 'rs'! Rupert is super cute! Bennett Gabriel Anthony Samuel Owen Ian Vincent Robert Emanuel Isaiah I like Owen but again taken by a cousin. Bennett and Vincent are too surname sounding to me. I like Robert but not Rob and I like Gabe but not Gabriel (I have always thought it sounded too feminine, but my husband is a huge Penny Arcade fan and would probably like it). Ian is a bit too old man'ish. Emanuel and Isaiah, not a fan. Anthony just sounds a little too boring. I don't mind Samuel, it doesn't scream at me like ' If it helps my favourite girls name was Elizabeth. James Arthur Jasper Milo Oscar Sebastian Isaac Theo Theodor Magnus Weird, I think of Ian as a very young name - never heard of anyone older than ~30 named it, and according to records it was barely known a name until the '60s or so, and only became popular in the '80s, peaking in the 2000s. Reuben, to me, is *much* more old-mannish! In Australia in just one state (we seem to lack a national database) it was consistently in the top 10 to 20 popular names from the 1950's, it fell in popularity from the 1970's but stayed in the top 50 until the 1980's when it dropped to top 100 before completely falling off in the 90's. So everyone had a Dad named Ian when I was growing up. I remember someone from Australia saying something similar about Keith - to me, Keith and Ian were both born in the '70s or '80s!

These are my only two viable options for cards at the moment, given the current crazy demand on cards. MY BAD: I meant 7950s I assume you meant 7950's, not 7750's. Depending on the model of 7950, I've seen people push over 700 Kh/s per card. When you take into account the power savings you get from the 7950's as well, which could net you 2.1 That said, the 290's are easier to re-purpose if you ever stop mining, as they're still top of the line gaming cards. You'll only hit ~1.9 Mh/s with them though. In my opinion, the 7950's have a bit of an edge - the 290s have just been driven up in price too much lately. I mine at around 990 Kh/s+ on 290Xs. But, I also have a rig with 7970's here and it was roughly the same price and outperforms it a bit on power and hashes. But 290s get much more than 800 kh Easily 960+. i can only get about 880Kh /s out of my 290, even on the 290X bios switched over, i cant get more than 800Kh but i gain way more preformace in games and benches switched to the 290X bios? 13.12 drivers, 1025/1500, 32765 TC, 1 gpu thread Same results in BAMT and Win7 Depends on elipda vs hynix memory, but I did hear of someone else who couldn't get past 880. hmm, I'm stuck at 880kh Its an XFX.

When you mine, you do not put the cards in crossfire. For mining, each card is doing its own calculations, Crossfire (or SLI for NVidia cards) does not give any benefit. You want each card to mine separately. So I would run a new instance of the batch script for each card? How would I assign the script to each card (is that an option in the script)? You only need one instance of cgminer. There is a file called example.conf in your cgminer folder. Open it in notepad You separate each value with a comma. Any insight on if I should go with the 7750s or R9 290xs? If you are actually referring to 7750s and are paying that much for them, then go for the 290Xs. Yeah, my mind was fried today from researching. I meant 7950's lol 3 cards is always preferable to 2 in the case that one of them fails.

Subreddit: explainlikeimfive A spectrum exists because the frequency of light change down/up the spectrum. i.e. Blue has a higher frequency then red. It wouldn't matter where in the electromagnetic spectrum you start, as long as your eyes are able to detect more than one frequency of light, you will see a spectrum of colour. In fact various animals (such as snakes) can detect infrared light. Actually, even bats using echolocation might interpret the sound information as a spectrum. That said, the Earth's atmosphere mostly blocks out electromagnetic waves of most frequencies besides visible light and radio waves. So it isn't a coincidence that we see in the visible light spectrum, and our technology uses radio waves to communicate. So would it be possible to make color IR cameras? There already are cameras in every range of electromagnetic spectrum. Here is [an image](http://rooksheathscience.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/image58.png) of the sun in three different 'spectrums'. Of course the images are false colours, so we can see them, since we would see nothing if they remained in UV or infrared. Nice, do IR rays reflect off of colors in a way that is predictable compared to their visible color, i.e. could you tell by the ir that reflects or is absorbed by something that it is red in visible light, and thus have full color nightvision? For example did they make that star red-orange because they knew it was that color, or were they able to make the imaging software so it recognized the color based off of the IR rays it was receiving? I'm going to assume you are asking how they choose the visible colours in the images when they are taken outside the visible range. They do that by making a sort of correspondence from the part of the EM spectrum they used to RGB (red green blue). For example, [images like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Lasvegas.terra.1500pix.jpg/800px-Lasvegas.terra.1500pix.jpg) that show vegetation might use a IRG -> RGB. This only works if the original image was taken using a spectrum outside the visible spectrum. Like, if you take a picture using only one colour, say red, then you dont have enough information to map it to a whole spectrum of RGB. Similarly, if you take a picture using only one IR colour then you can't do a true false colour mapping. Instead you assign value to RGB depending on how dark the pixels of the picture are. So dark blue to red; light blue to green or something like that. Examples of these images are those heat vission goggles that show heat in red and less heat in blue. So no there is nothing obvious or natural choosing red in visible spectrum to represent a certain colour outside the visible spectrum. Though the fact that the sun looks orange/red probably is because those are colours we associate with the sun. Just to clarify, because the question was kind of ambiguous. There wouldn't be separate spectra for each kind of frequency. Rainbows would just have more colors before red and after violet. would they look different though, like an entirely new color, or would it just be a repeat of the visible color spectrum? Color is based off wavelength. Longer wavelengths are on the red side, and shorter wavelengths are on the violet side. So if we're seeing UV light, it's an even shorter wave than violet, so we'd interpret a new color. I understand the wavelength - color relation, but I can't imagine a color outside of our current spectrum, it might just be too abstract to wrap my head around. Yeah it is unimaginable. If there's a color you can think of, you probably already know the name for it, and it's some combination of red, green, and blue. They would look different, as long as we had additional cones in our eyes that could detect them. I guess our brain could interpret them to be the same colour, but that seems redundant and pointless. Why see the same colour when you are expending energy to physically detect more."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I am only looking for white collar work that does not involve driving though. I will make sure to get a record of the expungement. The reason I ask about the DMV check is that when I was hired by my current job they ran a background and DMV (even though I don't drive for this company). I can get it expunged from the background but not the DMV, so it would not turn up on a CRC but it may for the DMV. Would you be aware of how this could be adjudicated for a non driving position if they found the expunged record through a driver's record check?

The previous doctor used this trick to trap four angels when they surrounded the tardis, and he disappeared, leaving them facing each other. Wouldn't they still be trapped in the angel's alternate time, even if they travelled? I never assumed they were trapped in that room or even that city. The angels could still feed off of them, right? This came up in another thread the other day, and I think the consensus was that the angels would just bring them back. I need to watch this episode again. Convenience writing? No matter where they go, they will need to be buried there in New York. If they travel elsewhere, I'm sure River would, as next-of-kin, have their remains buried there. There's something similar that bothers me too. Now 1938 is such a no no spot ( or at least a hot spot) yet Let's Kill Hitler AND last years Christmas show took place in that year. I imagine that if time travel were possible, Hitler's timeline would be pretty crowded. Everybody tries to kill Hitler their first time That made me laugh. It doesn't matter WHERE they travel to. The point is the book said in the last chapter Amelia's Last Farewell meaning Amy never sees the Doctor again, same with Rory, it has been written in time. Plus the afterword in the book confirms it by telling him how they lived a good life. River She did say she would tell Amy to write the afterword. Yet she was there with the Doctor once Amy was touched by the angel so I imagine it could've affected her the same way it did the Doctor. She could've delivered the book to her by mail....??? Moffat. Maybe they were focusing on the people and being careful not to look at each other. To me, they seem like a much more organized group of angels. The ones in Blink were scavengers and were just surviving. They were acting erratic by trying to get into the Tardis after all. AMY'S **LAST FAREWELL Can't you read? I think you are reading more into what I wrote than what is actually there, which is ironic. that was not the season finale. amy and rory are not coming back, because the only characters to come back have been captain jack, who wasn't really a companion, and sarah jane, who came for one episode and was ditched again. Jack was a companion briefly. Jack is independent of the doctor. But still qualifies as a companion. Adam was a companion and didn't make it past one trip, but it still counts. Jack lost his ship and travelled in the TARDIS, only regaining independence after being abandoned on the Game Station and leaving via his vortex manipulator. You suggested he never was a companion in a real sense. jack is not a formal companion because he only hitch hikes, like river. But he was a formal full time companion at one point. The Doctor Dances* to *The Parting of the Ways He didn't hitchhike then, that was full time, unlike River. but he left on his own. he came on his won and left of his own accord. He came because it was either that or be killed when his ship exploded. It wasn't his choice to leave; he was exterminated, then revived, but the TARDIS dematerialised without him, leaving him there. Not his choice. but he could still return on his own. his companionship is sporadic. But the point was that he actually was a companion. It sounded like you were saying he never was. also rose and martha. martha was alive and well when he left her, and rose came back because the universe was collapsing, and time has already collapsed (season 6) so they aren't going to bring them back. give what up? I believe /u/Karp42 is suggesting that you're looking for a way that Amy and Rory could be brought back to the show because they're not actually dead. This has come up a lot lately. Just knowing they're still alive, somewhere, is enough to get some people speculating on how they'll be brought back. Wishful thinking, I know. everyone is trying to find ways that the ponds will come back, but they're not going to. I are not doing that, so it's not *everyone"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I know the wait is terrible and the hype quickly becomes off the charts as time passes, but if it means we get the finale that Dontnod wants, and if Life Is Strange & The Witcher 3 can inspire publishers to give studios a break so they can make better games instead of struggle endlessly with stupidly low budgets, ridiculously short deadlines, and backwards marketing requirements, 2015 would be a true milestone in the industry. Anyway what I mean is, if Dontnod wants to take more time to make a better finale, they absolutely, definitely have my blessing. Besides, 28 july + 6 weeks = mid september at the earliest I wouldn't be mad either though just soooo hyped. I like seeing all the theories that pop up in that time too! September is my bday Id be down for a 2-3 month wait. Just hoping we can all fill up the time between then and keep ourselves from exploding In my opinion, we're looking at an Episode 5 release date gap of Sept. 22nd (being that it was a pattern of 8 week per episode) to Oct. 6th (if adding another extra two weeks, like they did with releasing Ep. 4). But, then again, that's only a prediction, nothing's said in stone yet. All in all, by the time autumn shows start premiering, we will be getting our conclusion(s) to this beautiful game. I agree and all, but I just want the ending of LiS to come out before Fallout 4 because if it's after I don't think I'll have too much interest in playing the end. LiS is like a David Cage game but actually good. I never got to play beyond. Just watched on YT. I liked watching it but it must've been annoying to actually play lol. Heavy Rain was on another level though. Beyond was just terrible. Not only in terms of playing it, but the story itself was filled with so many damn massive, gaping plotholes, it feels at times like they wrote out the whole story in one sitting and didn't look over or revise it once. Heavy Rain had some plot holes too, but nothing on the level of Beyond. but I might be biased cause I absolutely love Ellen Page Also, it had a unique feel to it. In hindsight, it's a rather awful game. Like, if whoshisface looses his eye, *NO ONE MENTIONS A FUCKING THING. Although the fact that if you grabbed your teddy bear at one point, ti shows up in the end. Fuck, the whole Date Night sequence was awesome as it shows what her life could be like normally. Even LiS Hasn't captured that feeling yet. It's a really funny thing about David Cage. His games are pretty badly written, and I have a blast playing them, but his ego really gets to me sometimes. All the things he set out to do with his games: emotional story telling, minimal use of violence as a solution, choice and consequences, Dontnod did 10x better and with(I'm betting) not even half the budget of one of his games. Cage has the right idea, but his execution can be absolutely horrible sometimes, like the final act of Indigo Prophecy. A script editor would do wonders for the quality of his games. I can't give him too much shit though, since Indigo Prophecy was my first foray into the point and click adventure genre and that led me to Life Took the thoughts out of my head. His games are what lead me to the choice driven games today also. Maybe I've just been playing too much GoT (Telltale), but I don't think LiS is going to end well I'd suggest you go back to the very end of episode one and take a closer look at the last vision Max sees at the lighthouse. hope lies within. I don't play TTG's GoT but i read and watch the show. Haha bad endings are our specialty. I hope they implement multiple bad and good endings maybe like 2 or 3 each.

I havent taken off the current fixture yet so i dont know the wire size but im assuming its 14. Yes, most fixtures come with thinner wire than that of the circuit. They only have to support the current of the fixture itself, not that of the whole circuit like the wires in the walls. Just make sure you make a solid connection and secure with an appropriately sized wire nut. Whats the theory behind it? the wire only takes the load amps? wouldnt the wires need to be the circuit amp as well since it needs to complete a path to the neutral? The wire to the fixture only carries the load of the fixture itself. So even if the hot supplies 15 amps this fixture wire will only draw the amp neccesary for the load only and not the full 15 amps? The hot has the potential to supply 15 amps, the fixture will only draw what it needs from that 15 amps. ok makes sense. I guess my mistake was thinking there was a constant 15 amps rather than ability for 15 amps. It's a very common misconception. I had to explain to a carpet cleaner that it was OK to plug his machine that needs a 20A circuit into the 30A garage circuit. (It's a truck-mounted system but it's electric. Voltage is constant while amperage differs In household terms , 15A is *a lot* of current. When you use say, a 60W bulb, that 60 comes from 120V x the number of amps it draws. So the amount of amps drawn by that bulb is 0.5. Now consider that most fixtures now are filled with CFL or LED bulbs drawing less than a dozen watts and you can see that the current draw for a fixture is truly minimal compared to that of an entire 15A circuit."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I am looking to purchase my first bike. I am looking for something that I can occasionally ride to work and have some fun with on the weekends. Due to budget reasons I am not able to purchase a new bike so I have been looking on craigslist at specifically a honda CM400/450. I found two that I like so far here. Any opinions and advice about where to find parts, If these are good options, or general stuff to look out for would be greatly appreciated. And before anyone asks because of the second bikes current state I am a mechanic, so fixing it up won't be too difficult for me. If anyone has suggestions for me to look elsewhere at different options too, I am interested in hearing what you have to hear. I would watch a few video guides on youtube about how to buy a used motorcycle first; there is simply too much to write here. I also wouldn't buy such an old bike unless you plan to do some work on it. What is your budget? At the end of the day it is hard to get a roadworthy bike for under a grand. Something for $500 usually needs $500 in parts to be safe and reliable. Don't forget the cost of safety equipment too. I spent more on gear than I did for my first bike. Budget is about $1000, and I definitely don't mind doing a little work on it. I have about 4 or so months before it's safe to ride on Minnesota streets anyways so I have some time to get it road worthy. My advice is to get a newer bike unless you truly enjoy working on them. A Rebel 250 or Ninja 250 is a good starter. The next size up I'd recommend would be a Ninja 500 or a GSF500. A 1980ish 400 is pretty close to a modern 250 in terms of performance. Those bikes are small and slow. They also have some unique motor parts that like to sometimes fail. And there aren't any replacements available. for a starter bike, if you can turn wrenches, might work for a while, but I would try to not throw much money at it. Also, probably want to stay off the highway with anything under 550ccs (as far as older bikes are concerned). There really is so much to consider its hard to give blanket advice. But assume you'll drop the bike at least a few times, and assume you'll break something at least one of those times. Get a good helmet and jacket, and wear boots and heavy pants. Be careful and learn to ride and figure out what kind of riding suits you, or if it's really even your thing. Buy or build a bike more to your suiting once you're good an comfortable. I figured because I am a new rider that I would probably drop it once or twice. Which is why the 450 looks more appealing because of the price. The spokes don't look too difficult to find and the front turn signal can easily be fixed as well. And if it runs well for a few months I would have a chance to figure out if I want a better one or not. What engine parts are you talking about by the way? There is a chain tensioner or sprocket or something to do with the valve timing that goes out and no one makes a replacement. I haven't dealt with it, but I was thinking of buying one and a coworker told me about the issue, as he's had about a dozen of these bikes and about twice as many motors for them. Coworker at a motorcycle shop. Ninja 250. They are abundant, cheap, reliable and parts are out the ass. yamaha virago ~750. No chain, smooth handling, you sit in it instead of on it. It's a really easy bike to get around on and learn with, it's what I learned on well, actually I had a 1100, but it was still really easy to handle. I took lessons and that's what they had. It felt like riding a bicycle.... nothing to it. Go with an older model. Don't get the bike you really want, because when you drop it, you're heart will be broken. Get something you can drop and not be quite so upset. 80s Japanese motorcycles often make great starter bikes. They're reliable, fun, cheap and great to learn on. If you wreck it, you can just leave it at the dump and move on. My riding career started this way. As already mentioned, a few things to keep in mind are time and costs of parts and repairs. My cm450 needed another $400 in parts a couple weeks after purchasing it. Chain, sprockets, battery, tires, etc. The CM450 you listed will suffer here - bent shifter, broken turn signal, missing rear turn signals all together and who knows what else. You will spend more time working on this bike than riding it. For these reasons, I would forget the CM450 and take a motorcycling buddy to look at the CM400. If it runs cold, has decent tires, chain/sprockets, brakes, and you could get a season out of it with minimal invested in repairs, I would consider buying it. Ride it for a season, sell it at the end, and move up. I will keep you all posted on what I end up doing here in a few weeks or so. get a dual sport, a suzuki dr 200 is imo the best starting bike"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

First off, we don't *know There's no point in getting worked up over perceived slights between corporations. I highly doubt Hasbro was in the dark on this, and it doesn't really matter for DHX one way or the other. [](/sp) Secondly, animation studios work on more than one project at a time. They can (and most likely do) work on the show and EQG concurrently. Which is why they have different directors. Plus, all of this is written well ahead of time, so in the end when they're produced doesn't matter that much. The point is that the decision to split S5 in two parts was (probably) made after S5 and FG was done. They were meant to be watched in different order. Without that split, S5 would ended first and we would get FG after that. Who is down voting you over this? Come on people, this person worrying about something isn't hurting your feels. I think they exist as a separate line of story, so to speak. So far, we have yet to fully see them cross over (save for Flash Sentry's cameo). Crystal castle in Rainbow Rocks. Alicorn Twilight in Equestria Girls. Imagine watching EQG in the middle of S3 or watch RR in the middle of S4. [](/scootaplease)Magical Mystery Cure aired in 2013-02-16, EQG premiered at 2013-06-16. Twilight's Kingdom part 2 in 2014-05-10, RR in 2014-09-27. So both movies have had a bit of distance from the spoiler territory. For tidbits in Friendship Games, for one, we don't even know (so far) if Equestrian Twilight is featured here at all. Promotional material hasn't alluded to her crossing over yet, for that we need to wait. Human world Twilight and the human Mane 6 seems to have their own story thread. We also don't know if the movie is *intended* to be after S5 prime. We can only wait and see. It's a good point, but as others have said it's probably not worth worrying about at this time. If there's going to be a story conflict we just have to hope that it's small enough to be a *tease* for the rest of Season 5, and not a full blown spoiler. Everyone else on this subreddit is too nice to call you out on it, but you're kind of being an idiot right now. You have no reason to believe your hypothesis, that DHX and Hasbro would be so careless as to include a spoiler for episodes that haven't aired yet, and yet when people try to provide a reasonable response for you you're ignoring them. including a spoiler for episodes that haven't aired yet is not they being careless. It's not their fault. The movie was supposed to air after season 5. Discovery Family then stupidly decided to split the season in 2 parts and put the movie between them. Basically the same thing that happens here in Czech Republic all the time. Some TV shows have episodes broadcasted in wrong order, because our TV stations screw up all the time. Except Hasbro would have stepped in and not released the movie until after season 5, if they needed to. If they had already decided to release the movie at this time, then they would have already finished the episodes(or at least enough to have them ready in time). If they have to keep the episodes un-aired for some time, they can do the same for the movie. Discovery Family can force Hasbro to show the movie before Hasbro wants to show it. Not with the team of lawyers Hasbro can hire/has hired. Plus, you seem to be forgetting one thing. We don't know if DF made this decision. It might just be taking longer time then they expected to make the episodes, so they as well release a non-spoilery movie mid-season. We actually do know that DF made this decision.

I am sure that it matters little to a family that dies because a driver, who was temporarily drunk crosses over the middle line into oncoming traffic. You're an idiot aren't you? You don't understand the significance of temporary vs permanent do you? Purchase a car? Get a driver's license? i could support drug/alocohol testing in order to get a license. I'll bet a lot of lives could be saved if we did this Maybe there should be some kind of test standard to post on Reddit. The sole purpose of a car isn't to kill. The only function of a gun is to kill. The functions of a gun include non-lethal defence. Aside from that, don't feed the trolls. Guns are not made to be used non-lethally, but you make a good point about trolls. I'm talking about the innocent people who die because of impaired drivers.

Subreddit: formula1 I think it was great that they showed more of the back story of Max. It's been a long time coming and I really think it will help people understand why he's there and not just ridicule him for so young. On the other hand though, seeing how his father Jos brought him into the sport. How much time, effort and money he spent. Did Max really have much of a choice? What are your thoughts? If he hadn't really liked it, he wouldn't have been putting so much effort in for so many years. Someone who doesn't really want to can only be pushed so far. It was definitely a wonderful piece they put together. The issue is he doesn't know anything else, his whole life is racing, a lot else is unknown. Even if he wanted to change he probably couldn't imagine what it would be like. Lol, it's not like he didn't go to school or something. TIL School is like real life, with all the experiences that you could ever hope to have. Jos definitely comes across as living vicariously through Max at times. However, Max legitimately seems to love racing and motorsport so it's not like he was unwillingly pushed into this career. I don't think he was forced into it. If I recall correctly Jos wanted to buy him a kart when he turned 6 or 7 but Max nagged and moaned so long he got one at 4 (?) This was from a Dutch interview. I think this film made it very clear that Max loves racing more than anything else. Wonderful to see. As a Dutch Max fan I follow him on social media and news sites etc. I've notices that both Max and Sainz are extremely commited to F1. It's really all they do. Max even has an iracing set up at home so he can do more racing while at home. When he was 11 years old a Dutch sports TV show (Holland Sport) did a duo interview with him and his father. At that age he was very clear about wanting to race and his F1 ambitions. When he was 4 Jos said no at first when Max wanted a cart, but after nagging Jos caved in and bought one. If he was somewhat unsure about racing I truly believe he wouldn't be where he is now. F1 is a world class sport and no Dutch person can buy himself into it without talent due to the lack of Dutch sponsors, unless you are married to the daughter of Marcel Boekhoorn of course. This is no jab at Guido van der Garde, because I like him, but he isn't Max Verstappen. Guido van der Garde Hehe. Anyone got the source of this? I felt uneasy watching this. If you bring up a child and show them nothing in life other then motorsport, it's no wonder they will grow up enjoying it. I just feel like Max likes motorsport the same way those brought up in a religion are religious. He doesn't know anything else. From what I understand he's basically been raised to get to where he is so, he hasn't had any choice but then he's never really seen anything else They gave him his choice but once he made it, he had to commit fully. Of course they put him in a kart at a young age, but would you turn that down? He did karting mostly as a hobby (though they did get enough money and sponsorship to take it up a notch) but it wasn't until KF3 where he was put to the test to see if he wanted to make a career out of it. I'm not sure what interview but i'm pretty sure his dad did in no way push him to go racing. It was his own choice. Which to be fair: is always better in the end. Just saw the video by the link posted by BikkenS. Interesting item but it doesn't really show that much. I found it to be oddly edited and feature not very interesting questions. For a whole day of filming, they sure did found out very very little. A few moments seemed like they had an interview but only aired a few soundbites from it. Like i said elsewhere, he wasn't really pushed into doing this. It was his own choice and own feat. Yes his dad payed for much but he already made a lot of money racing so it wasn't that big of a deal. I can imagine he put some money aside when his son was born to make sure he could sponser whatever he needed. Anyways, when he made his choice, his dad made sure he was fully commited to it and began training. It was tough as many can see from this and other interviews, but gets a bit of help from the sheer amount of talent he has. What still bugs me is that he's not very photogenic and his English (pronounciation) isn't very good. He should improve on those 2 points too, aside from racing. He's 17 and English is his second language. He's not going to be the most charismatic person ever at the start of his career. Ricciardo was happy and smiling and seemed extremely happy and comfortable when he got his first podium, but Kvyat just seemed awkward. I know about his second language. I'm Dutch myself, so i know what level of English education you get at school There are many other drivers (even Dutch ones) that have a better understanding and pronounciation than you see here (same for Kvyat, his English teacher will probably hate himself now). Some drivers get better at it though. Compare Vettel now with how he was a few years ago when just joining Torro Rosso. It comes much more natural to him now. So there's still hope for Max but knowing how its tought at schools here in The Netherlands, it should be better then the level of English he has right now. One reason would be that he missed a few lessons and stuff because of the racing, but being abroad a lot of time would kinda counter that too. To**r**o The main point is that he's 17. Most 17-year-olds aren't the most charismatic, exciting people in the world."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

What precautions should I take in refluxing, distilling, storing and general handling? How do you propose to do this synthesis? I did a bunch of low temp work so I can probably help You will obviously not be doing this at ambient temperature so everything must be kept cold but what are you planning on using? Do you have a procedure already in hand? me and my friend want more practical experience in chemistry so have asked our professor if we can perform experiments in our own time (supervised partially by him and technicians). My friend is going to do ethyl ethanoate. We're planning to follow a modified version of the method from an older version of Vogel's Practical Guide. Ethanol, glacial ethanoic acid, sulphuric acid catalyst. Reflux for ~6 hours, using a heating mantle. Various washes. Dry. I'm just wondering what kind of problems we may encounter interacting with a chemical with such a low flash point, and how we should safely store it. Room temperature for us is probably ~19- 21C. I assume that will be a problem. keep it below it's boiling point (77'C) make sure it doesn't get into contact with any sparks/sources of ignition and store it in a flamables cabinet. The flash point of a substance is the temperature where it can ignite in air, what you want to do, is keep it below it's autoignition temperature, above which, it'll sponaniously ignite. Here's a video on the synthesis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFxZ0NircIk don't do anything stupid with it, and it should be only marginally more flamable than ethanol So distilling it would be out of the question? As that would require heating it to > 77C. Heating it is perfectly fine. The 77'C thing is more of a tip for storage. Just use a heating mantle or water bath with a condenser with (preferably) ice water in it, and avoid sparks/ignition sources This is it here. I thought for some reason you had to stay below the flash point but for what you're doing you are fine if you don't do stupid things. I've heard bad things about keeping low flash point liquids in fridges. Friend's chemistry department had a fridge explosion and fire due to ether vapors finding their way to the hot part of the pump. There are XP fridges. What's an XP fridge? I assume it's cold storage specifically for solvents like this Explosion proof fridges, which are intrinsically safe, and have no exposed circuitry, meaning vapours can't get into pumps, light switches and fans to prevent ignition of any fumes. not essential for ethyl acetate. store it in a flammables cabinet or if you still want to use a regular fridge, double bag it with a zip lock bag before putting it in the fridge Thanks for the response, we ended up going with methyl benzoate and methyl salicylate. Much higher flash points. I don't think you really have much to fear with this, to be honest. I know it's a really late response, but ethyl acetate isn't usually going to cause any problems related to its flammability. Ethanol has a flash point below room temperature, but people don't freak out about distilling it, generally. Even if you had a few dozen lit candles in the room you conduct the distillation in, ethyl acetate isn't going to be volatile enough to evaporate and spread around the room after being cooled to liquid state in a condenser, as occurs in a distillation. My lab is located in my laundry room, the same room that has an open flame due a heater nearby. I distill heptane, ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetone, you name it all the time in there. Unless you're directly boiling gigantic amounts of the solvent directly into the air in the room, there's not going to be a significant enough concentration of fuel to even cause a fire or explosion.

So that wasn't a really bad joker? Lex is my pick for a razzie this year I was afraid of it being really terrible as well - but it ultimately exceeded expectations by being ok. Movie definetly has severe scripting problems and is completely overloaded - but thinking of how awful Man of Steel was, I felt Snyder did an ok job here. Something of this scale should not only be OK. It should be nothing but amazing. why did you think man of steel was bad? It was way too long and basically consisted of pretty boring action scenes with Superman and General Zod destroying buildings while fighting Story wanted to be deep but ultimately was just long. But I guess it comes down to the fact of me thinking that Superman is a boring super hero I think this is where DC tends to fall into, trying to be deep but just lacking in some aspect which i cant pinpoint. It was definitely subpar/bad, however, terrible might be overstating it. Nevertheless, it was not good. Fans are the most pissed of how underwhelming this movie was. I expected a nice movie, and in my opinion i got a very nice movie. Well i'm a DC fan, and i was dissapointed that this was a Batman movie, and every superhero in it was Batman by any other name, even superman. Yea, you don't choose that kind of batman when your having both characters meet for the first time. ANd making superman super dark in MOS then trying to say sorry for the destruction doesn't do anything than tell you they didn't believe in their initial vision. As for benching and squats, Bruce Wayne was old and it showed, nothing at all to do with him making gains just for a montage. Not to mention they actually had a reason to fight and he was only faking his irrational reason to destroy Superman because Batman is actually smart and thinking one step ahead. Maybe you need to rewatch or reread it. Yeah, DKR Batman is so different than any other Bats we've seen so far. He's like a bit more sane Rorschach.

Subreddit: heroesofthestorm I have only gotten the new map once, and I'm starting to question if it will ever happen again. I had the same problem when Tomb of the Spiderqueen came out. It felt like that map was picked less than the other ones. Random is random. It is inherently unbalanced. Sometimes you get streaks. (This includes streaks where one entry doesn't happen) Actually there is something to prevent it from being too random. The first line under User Interface Significantly reduced the likelihood that players will receive the same Battleground multiple times in a row when playing in matchmaking game modes. That means just that players are less likely to be put into the same map several times in a row. However, the rates of all the map appearing are random and even. Just check on [Hotslogs](https://www.hotslogs.com/Default) (at the bottom of the page, Sitewide Map Statistics over the Last 7 Days section) all the matches uploaded in the last week, the numbers of each map appearing are very close one to another. I think you are just being really unlucky and are thinking too much about it. Not every game is listed on HotSlog as far as I know. I believe it requires that someone uploads a replay of the match. Yes, it's true, but if every game would be listed, the differences between those numbers would be even smaller. Basics of statistics state that with a higher sample rate, the result would be more exact. On Hotslogs we have a lower sample rate, but still very relevant to my idea. I don't believe you can just say that, you can only make the assumption that the differences would be smaller. Yes, it's not really that the differences are smaller, it's just that the differences become more and more negligible. Consider that you have a die and you want to see how many times each side faces upwards. If you roll the die 20 times, you may get something like 5 times 6 but only 2 times 1. The absolute difference is 4, but we can say that 6 was rolled more than twice as often as 1. Now, if you roll the die 10000 times, then the differences between each values rolled will be a higher, probably a few hundreds, but overall, we can say that the differences are so negligible that we can safely say that each value rolled roughly 1/6 of the times. Now imagine the same with the actual games and the HotsLogs replays: Only a part of the games are updated to Hotslogs, but we can already say that each map is played roughly 1/8 of the times. If we add the rest of the games, then yes, the differences may not be smaller, but they will surely be more negligible percentage-wise. I am pretty sure that there is a more official formula of what I am explaining here, but I only did basic statistics in school Yes, but those who do upload tend to upload every single one of their games, meaning it's still a statistically significant set. new map was all i played last week, just a different rotation this week. I've been noticing that I play on Haunted Mines more than normal. There are 8 maps, so whenever you start a game you have 7/8 (87.5%) chance of not getting the new map. After they reset the map rotation to 8 maps (when only 4 maps were active when they introduced BoE) I thougth that they removed BoE because I had 35 games in a row not seeing that map. That have a 0,93% chance of happening. I know it's random, and there are streaks, probabilities and stuff like that, but I think something is wrong with the algorythm.

I don't think running through it had any effect on the healing process, really? Just make sure you can shower and change right away when you're done with your run!

Can't be too safe right? Get samsung25rs or similar from a known big name battery manufacturer from a website that specializes in battery sales or vapor product sales , i dont know what site you guys have in the UK though Don't buy batteries from Amazon. Li-ion Wholesale, Lightningvapes or Illumn are more reputable battery vendors, they're in the sidebar. Also don't buy Efest. You may get lucky and get a decent battery, but chances are it's crap. Stick with Samsung 25R, Sony VTC5 or any of the following LG batteries: HE2, HE4, HG2. It can be a genuine efest, but efest doesn't tell you what kind of battery is actually under the wrapper. It could be rated for 10 amps, it could be rated for 20. Better to buy from a trusted brand. Efest doesn't make batteries, they just rewrap b-grade batteries from companies that do. This means that you never really know what's under the wrap. A 35A cell could really be a 10A cell under the wrap. Even batteries that people like Mooch have tested to be decent can't fully be trusted, since these companies (not just efest) have been known to use different cells in different production runs, all under the same wrap. I'd spend the few extra bucks and get Samsung 30Qs or LG HG2s.

For those who vape below or around 50W, you'll get better battery life out of a Samsung 30Q or LG HG2, both 3000mAh 20A cells. Not really seeing where to buy them in the uk, that's the problem, though I don't plan to max it at 75w, the option would be nice. I've looked around and found one place that has a decent selection of 18650 batteries in the UK: I can't vouch for the vendor, however I'd always try to steer clear of Amazon er Ebay for batteries, just too much fake stuff on there. If you want more capacity, the 30Q or HG2 are both excellent choices. Going to go for a pair of 25R's thanks so much for the help, really appreciated. ** can't type efest into searchbar goodbye jaw so is 20A then when Pico says 25A or more? looking at the samsung battery. Manufacturers often overstate the needed amp ratings for their devices, since they anticipate people buying chinese rewraps (like efests) with exaggerated amp ratings. In theory, you need 25A to run 75W continuously. However, since most people don't max out their mods and a typical hit lasts only a second or two, you can usually get away with less."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: changemyview I honestly can't understand why they teach the five senses in school, when most people know we have six or perhaps more senses. I'm not talking about the sense of time either, as real as that may be. The senses are: Photons hitting the back of your eye, as focused by your lens. Pressure waves in the air moving your eardrum, compared to more static air in the inner ear. Fluid movement sensed by tiny hairs in the inner ears. * Taste. Chemical reactions to sensors on the tongue. * Smell. Chemical reactions to sensors in the nose. Sensed by skin nerves aided by small hairs. These are real senses, each with well known sensory organs. These senses tell us information relative to the environment around us. Are we in the light? Are we touching the wall? We can feel it. Are we rotating? We can sense it. Actually the whole 5 senses thing isn't in fact true. However, we have more than 6 senses. Start with your basic 5. Sense of presence (close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Sense of Balance (falls under the rotation that you mentioned) There are many others that are debated and discussed such as empathy (sense of others' emotions) and Flight/fight response (sense of danger). I assumed OP was arguing that there were only 6 rather than that there were just more than the normal 5 Rule 1? You argued that people had 6 senses. I'm stating there are more No one is going to say there are only 5, because it is a fact that there are more. I thought you were arguing just for a singular addition to the normal five The reason the five senses are taught in school is because they come from Aristotelian philosophy - basically it's tradition. Aristotle was wrong about a lot of things. Something you still didn't mention is the sensation of pain, balance, proprioceptive sense, temperate and there's a whole host of others. I think it's helpful to teach about sensation in school, and this is just a primer the same way addition and subtraction is a primer to mathematics. These senses are also the easiest to teach and to learn and the ones that we are most consciously dependent on for communicating with other humans which gives it a social importance. What do you mean with the many ? Why not everyone? Well, some people are blind/deaf/etc. The reason that 5 senses are taught in schools is likely because it's simple and easy for children to understand the concept of sense if you only give them a few to remember. There are between 9 and 21. I don't understand why you want us to change your mind. It's a fact and not a view or opinion."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Well, it came back from hiatus for 1 chapter and now it's back on hiatus. The [scanlator's update it's status as each new monthly magazine comes out. So from the looks of it, no one knows when a new one will be coming out. Also what is a aggregate site? An aggregate site is a website that 'steals manga'. We all know that scanlators are illegally uploading manga--but with their free time put into translating it into English for others to enjoy it. Scanlators upload to their own website (which can be found through manga-updates, the manga database site) or to Batoto (collective website made by scanlators for scanlators). That way website traffic goes to them so they can generate a little bit of money to keep the website up and fund buying the next issue of 'whateveryourinterestedin'. Aggregate sites like Mangafox, mangareader, and so on take the manga from the scanlator's website and put it on their own. Slapping a watermark, reducing file quality without permission. This allows for the aggregate site to divert page views to themselves, thus, taking away the ad-revenue so they get the money----instead of the scanlators who did all the work. As stated before: >Scanlators [sic] own website (which can be found through manga-updates, the manga database site) or to Batoto. What are some well known examples of aggregated sites that do this and where might someone find a list of scantalator sites instead? Aggregate sites: any collective manga reading site that isn't the scanlator's site and isn't batoto. So mangafox, mangareader, mangapanda, mangahere, tenmanga, mangapark, mangaeden, unixmanga. Where to find scanlator sites: manga-updates. It's a manga database without having manga hosted on it. Groups Scanlating shows any and all groups that worked on scanlating it. Each one is a link to the information page about the group. Under Latest Release(es) you can see the most recent chapter out and who did it and how long ago. Evil Genius did chapter 333, 158 days ago. To give them the proper credit and page views so their website gets money you can click their [name](http://www.mangaupdates.com/groups.html?id=182) to view their group-specific data. And they have a link to their [website](http://www.evil-genius.us/) listed. On there you can read their scanlations in what ever format they serve it in. Scanlators will almost always tell you if series goes on hiatus or if they drop it rather than you twiddling your thumbs wondering why xyz series hasn't had a chapter in weeks. If you make a manga-updates account you can add manga to your list. And you'll get updates/notifications (be it via email or just from you logging in) so you know exactly when a scanlation group released the lasted chapter in whatever series you're following. If you wanted a list of all scanlation groups that existed. [They have a full list here.](http://www.mangaupdates.com/groups.html?page=1&perpage=100) 3,832 groups. Why is batoto exempt from being considered an aggregated site? The scanlators themselves give permission to Batoto to host their work. Not a single chapter on there isn't without written consent from the scanlators. Batoto also splits their profits from ad-revenue equally and proportionally to the scanlators represented on there. And Batoto doesn't degrade the page quality. All manga pages are presented in their original format, with original quality, and no gaudy watermark is slapped on there. Great information.

It just depends on what you really want to do or what you think will benefit you later.

But right now, for at least a few more point on Vitality couldn't hurt. I would prioritize boosting your Vitality and Endurance both to 20 as soon as possible.

Subreddit: canadaguns Hi folks, I am looking for a 12.5 barrel for my 870. This is for bear protection, and to turn my 870 into an all around backpack gun. Canadaammo has them for $150, however they only have modified choke in stock. After reading lots of forum arguments, it looks like it's fine to shoot slugs through a modified choke, many say to the benefit of accuracy. BUT, these people aren't talking about SBS. Will the short barrel have any effect? Is a modified choke a good choice to shoot slugs from? Love this board. edit: also just noticed that barrel only has a 2 3/4 chamber. Are there short barrels that accept 3? Shouldnt hurt accuracy at all, the short sight radius may effect the accuracy a bit. I would recomend bear spray for bear protection though, its alot more likely to save your life. Yeah I carry bear spray. I generally don't carry firearms while out for the day (prospecting). Too heavy anyway. More for keeping at the camp, taking on the quad in case we have a serious issue. We did hit a hot spot last summer through where we were literally shooing away black bears like dogs. One even stole a bear spray canister. I found it the next day with multiple teeth marks in it. The chamber length isn't really an issue, most slugs only come in 2 3/4 You're probaly going to see a reduction in accuracy with a 12 barrel by virtue of it being a 12 barrel Best bet is to grab a bunch of different slugs and see which ones shoot the best, then carry those. I don't think the accuracy on a 12 barrel is going to be any worse with a mod or cyl. but I carry buckshot not slugs. Yep that thing is completely badass. For 150 more than the barrel I am looking at it might not be a bad idea. I'd rather 5 shots than two, though. Do you keep it loaded when you are hiking? If I'm hiking with it I do, hammers down, safety on. I also use it as a quad gun for grouse and such. I also sometimes carry bear spray. It's lighter if you're going long distances and doesn't freak people out if you're likely to meet other people. I always figured I'd never have time to get more then two off so there wasn't much point in a pump. I also like how I can have two different loads (buckshot and a slug perhaps) and fire one or the other depending on which trigger I pull. I forgot you can leave the hammers down. It's either something like this or a Marlin .45-70 which I posted about a few months back (considerably pricier!). I like the mares leg in .357 mag too, to make your decision harder. I worked with a guy that had the Ranch hand, Might have been in .45 as well. Lots of fun. Those are beautiful. I've got one of these, and it's awesome, especially for the price. It breaks down into a really small footprint too, and reassembles very quickly. I bought it mainly to use as a slug gun, but beware! The kick isn't that bad on the shoulder, it's the trigger guard slamming into your fingers that hurts the most! I've put buckshot, birdshot, target shot and slugs through it, never a problem. Good to know Short barrels have no inherent inaccuracy problems when compared to longer barrels. Not sure where you got that information from. Short barrels do produce less velocity; that's about it. >Short barrels have no inherent inaccuracy problems when compared to longer barrels. Short barrel shotguns are (generally) harder to aim then long due to barrel length, epically if you're not use to them. That's where my statement comes from. I think that is fair. Traditional shotgun sights are harder to use, the shorter the barrel is. However, with a red dot, or ghost rings, there isn't any difficulty. It will be a louder bang and a flash. I would definitely be grabbing some better slugs. Not sure why those brenneke ones are so rare here. Everyone on the american forums talks them up. No stranger to higher prices. I have a rifled 870 barrel and went all out with the sabots. Ordered a box of every kind. Barrel is a little long though, rather keep it in good shape for hunting. Going with a smoothbore both for shorter barrel and so I can get a partridge when I feel like it. Challenger dangerous game slugs are available up here for about $2 each and should do the job. That's what I load my 14 870 with for the same purpose. You can order them from cabelas and various other places. They got a lot of punch to them. One thing to keep in mind with a short barrel is that you will need a tall front sight or a tall bead, otherwise the gun will shoot way high. So get a barrel with one of those tall rifle sights on it, or be prepared to go looking for oversize bead sights like the xs bigdot. DDupleks Monolit 32, 32oz steel slug in a plastic casing so it doesn't damage the barrel. There is also the Dupo, Hexolit, Rossa, AP-20, and Super Target (looks like a lawn dart) models of slugs.

Some think that Lash will be the tipping point in favor of the heroes in the final battle with hive. Some commenters say that the whole reason lash was made was to be a solution to hive."", ""dialog history"": ""Title: What do you think is the purpose of Lash? Subreddit: shield If I recall correctly in the previous episode, before Andrew turned into Lash, he told May to use Lash. Does anyone else think we might see a battle between Lash and H.I.V.E? I am assuming he is there to fight hive. Lincoln said that the inhumans powers were picked to balance things. He is a predator type Inhuman designed to maintain the equilibrium (as Lincoln put it) within the Inhuman species. Mack said he was like a shark The Kree knew how potentially dangerous the Inhumans would be and if their numbers increased too much they could easily destroy a planet ... not to mention likely be able to rebel against their masters. Inhumans like Lash were designed to keep the Inhuman population manageable. Thus Lash will be the secret weapon used to help defeat Hive. Well, Hive can destroy a planet all by himself, as we saw on Maveth, I think it will take an army of powerful InHumans acting together to defeat him. Didn't SquidWill say to Fitz that the civilization on that planet basically destroyed itself? Might have to rewatch the mid season finale. That's probably true, but Lash will likely be the thing one to tip the scales in favor of the heroes. That would be a nice, heartbreaking ending to his story. I think it would be awesome to, sort of, see Andrew/Lash redeem himself not only in the eyes of the fans, but in the eyes of May as well. With all this Inhuman powers fill a need, I'd say Lash's purpose is to thin the number of Inhumans now that there's an outbreak. Lash came into being out of Andrew's anger at Inhumans for the events that happened in Bahrain. In his mind they are responsible for the failure of his marriage to May and even though Andrew was a kind, well-adjusted person on the surface he had a ton of anger in his subconscious mind. Terrigenesis gave him a way to express that anger and while Lash is not what anyone would call a positive transformation Andrew needed it. Then again he might be a trigger put in place by the Kree to keep inhuman numbers down. Wouldn't want all your weapons growing beyond your control. The Kree wouldn't need to do that. Remember Vin-Tak? He came to Earth to investigate the diviner being activated. Sif sent him home but who knows to what extent the Kree monitor the Earth for use of the diviner. Regardless, the population of Inhumans remains small compared to the general population and tbh the Inhumans of today are very, very ignorant. It wouldn't be far fetched to assume that Hive is the only one alive who has any idea of the Inhumans origins other than that they're part alien. We don't know if the MCU Kree have the prophecy about the pink Kree killing them. If not then we need to establish what their motives for watching Inhumans are. I've posted this theory around here before, here I go again. Lash isn't so much designed to kill Hive as he is designed to be the solution to Hive. We haven't seen how yet, but Hive is able to control or otherwise sway Inhumans to his cause. He's pretty powerful on his own his real power is in his ability to control multiple Inhumans and integrate them as part of his Hivemind. Hive's pretty strong but Hive+hundreds of Inhumans with all sorts of interesting abilities all controlled by him is...terrifying. I posit that it's not *all * Inhumans he's able to control, and that Daisy is one of them. That's why Lash didn't kill her when he had the chance or otherwise show any desire to kill her. Daisy is worthy because she's an Inhuman that isn't susceptible to Hive's control. So Lash's instinct is to destroy the unworthy Inhumans so that they cannot be used by Hive. Let's also not forget that if every Inhuman fills a void, that Hive has a purpose and a reason too. I hope that will be explored a bit when we see more of his backstory/origins. I don't think it's a might The question I come to is whether or not Lash will survive the encounter. I don't think he will. Lash is around to die stopping Hive. Cull the herd. Lots of new Inhumans = New Inhuman that needs to kill Inhumans. Population control. Fight Hive, also prevent any Inhumans from falling under his sway - even if it involves killing them. That was my thought once he ran into that cube. They will unleash Lash vs. Hive, since Hive can't harm Inhumans (if I understood correctly). Also, Hive must have watched Matrix Reloaded a lot, because he's dressing like he's The One. If Hive Dies will this be the end of Brett Dalton since his original character Grant Ward is already dead? Pretty much what everyone here (and on other forums) think; Lash's sole purpose is to fight and/or kill Hive. Which is predictable, sort of like how I am certain that Fitz and Simmons will be eventually paired together (then it will end in one or both of their deaths. I mean that has been telegraphed since Season 1- it's obvious to everyone, just like how people were able to predict that Andrew is Lash. It's all too obvious and it's as subtle as being hit with a hammer over the head. [I wrote this a while ago saying he had a purpose and I got alot of hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/shield/comments/462n6u/lash_the_verdict/) It's a solid theory based on the Comics He does seem to be spreading that brush a bit wide.

As a side note, I am a newly graduated ME (BS) and am looking to expand my education horizons on my own while having fun with Arduino technology. the arduino IDE uses the avrgcc compiler, so it's C++. the framework used has a lot of methods and helpers that make it rather on the easy scale for C++, and you might not even recognize it as C++ until you start to get pretty advanced. any use of python would be on the PC side to talk to the arduino via usb-Serial. you can use any language on the PC side that has the ability to use a serial port, even matlab I think. So could you treat the entire Arduino sketch as you would C++ or are there Arduino specific commands? they can be found here http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage mostly function to interact with the hardware but you can also do that by shifting the value of variables. I have perused the reference page before. So as a verification, since it is all C++ the commands on the reference page share the same function as they do in all code? Or are they functions that were specifically added to the C++ language for the Arduino platform? it's c++, but it doesn't have the full stdlibs. the arduino IDE adds an #include Arduino.h to your sketch that pulls in the arduino framework when you compile. Stdlibs? it has some things, just not everything. And libraries are just groups of functions that allow you to not have to import every function ever made into your code, correct? I'm not doing anything to votes. some people are just bitter or something Would it be more accurate to say that calling libraries into your code allows more functionality available to your controller when the code is compiled?"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Thanks Gorka. theres a mustard coloured building that you can put a garage door on there. you can fit one car in there and place safes around it. Only thing I dealt with was a few zombies. Most ppl just drive past without realising its a base. It's close to Klen/Stary/Hero and Aircraft trader. I also have a mini base up on the mountain at Pik Kozlova (just north of cap golova). I have a safe up there full of goodies for when I respawn after death. I could be build a base overhanging the mountain. It also has a helipad and petrol tank up there. Any bandit problems? alot of ppl just drive past the main road without realising its there. People looting the area think its just a non enterable home. I use/check it from time to time. m looking at gorka right now. They have a fuel tank around a farm. (It's pretty close to skalisky) on friendly servers people usually went to Devils Castle. But the Dam up north has some nice fields for a base if you want to be further out of sight. *fields *out of sight well, unless someone specifically looks for a base, no one ever goes up there as there is absolutely nothing. that's out of sight  If you refer to helicopters looking for bases.. there is no out of sight in chernarus. Every base that is larger than 2 tents will be visible from air. But if you just want to build a nice clan-base where people don't stumble over by accident it's a decent spot. Ya one of my friends on the server took that already. Theres only 2 more castles i can take i think. I like Zubs I always used to set up cheeky bases in Berezino in the centre of the town. Go through the back of the supermarket (town centre, not near the apartments) there's a largely walled off area with a water pump (rear exit to the cafe comes into this area). Had a number of bases in this same spot across multiple servers, most of which were never discovered. There's room to hide a vehicle (mostly hide!) , water (obv), plus has the added benefit of being right near food and medical spawns. When they work/worked on servers (not played in a while) I'd tank-trap the main roads around the base to divert any passing traffic , this helped my precious jeep stash not get spotted; then block off any other unnecessary access points with wire. What's the point in having a base if everyone is friendly and no one attacks each other? Storing cars and shit mostly. and im bored No offense intended, but the idea of a server with no PVP (imo) seems like the reason you're bored. Theres PVP, but since were all friends we dont kill each other. We mostly help each other.

Sorry I can't be more specific it's been a while since I've played properly but I've always through this area would be a good place to have a base. Aight ill take a look From what I can recall, people have been able to pitch up tents near a dam/pond. Then again, they could've patched it up already People grid search and find tents so easily. Hiding out in the woods isn't as good as it used to be. Hiding near a landmark like the dam is also not smart. Go west on the main road out of Krasno (SP? After you get out of town there's a black house by itself kinda far back on the right. You can put tents IN the house. People never look there. It's a lone building that spawns shit loot and when you are that far north there is no real point in going in there. dosent matter. The server i play on is private and were all friends. we dont steal or kill each other. I think i found a good place in groka Not sure if you could call it a base, and I'm not sure how ethical it is, but there are a few boulders/rock escarpments that its possible to enter. The one i use now, fits a tent, safe and lockbox. Can't see it from the air or land, and the entrance is behind some bushes. Can't find it unless you know where to look, can't access the storage unless you know the right angle to walk. If you are playing vanilla Dayz, there is an Industial Building in the east of polona.

Subreddit: askscience When we have electrons filling up to the 2s orbital, that means we have a filled 1s orbital and a partially filled or fully filled 2s orbital. So since 2s orbital encompasses the 1s orbital does it mean the electrons from the 2s can enter the 1s orbital. Or is there some repulsion so the 2s electrons don't enter the 1s orbital. So do all the orbitals upwards have a similar issue like the p vs s orbital where the p orbital has only part of the dumbbell shape because part of it is covered by the s orbital? If so, why are we always taught that the p orbital has a dumbbell shape when most of it is already covered by the s orbital? Thanks in advance for the help Yes, there is penetration between orbitals. Check out these radial distribution functions: You'll find that there is, indeed, overlap. While inner shell electrons _does_ affect the outershell electrons by shielding the nuclear charge, they are not spatially exclusive. Common depictions of atomic orbitals is pretty much just an [overlay of individual atomic orbitals](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/D_orbitals.svg). What you need to keep in mind is that those orbital shapes are _not_ hard boundaries. That is, an electron in a 1s orbital isn't confined in that volume of space - that shape describes some fixed probability of finding the electron within that volume. You'll find that you can only get 100% probability of finding it when you extend the volume to all space, giving the trivial answer of yes, we have an electron somewhere in the universe. So with that in mind, you should see that orbital penetration readily occurs, between any given two orbitals. so they can actually go inside each other. But that's not too common I'm doing inoganic chemistry at a similar level to A levels Pauli principle) does *not * mean that 2s electrons also occupy the 1s orbital, in terms of quantum states. I thought two electrons *can* occupy the same point in space at the same time? The Pauli exclusion principle states that they cannot occupy the same quantum state, however two separate quantum states can occupy the same space. For example, a Helium atom has two electrons in the 1s orbital with opposite spin (because of Pauli). I believe that those electrons are equally likely to exist at any given point within the 1s orbital, and could certainly occupy the same point in a given instance. If this is true, I don't see any reason why any two electrons (no matter their spin) can occupy the same point in space, so long as they are in different (overlapping) orbitals. Obviously, the chances of this happening are pretty low though. If electrons cannot occupy the same space at the same time, I suspect it is due to electromagnetic forces- not Pauli. The Pauli exclusion principle states that they cannot occupy the same quantum state, however two separate quantum states can occupy the same space. A point in space (and a spin) is just a particular quantum state for an electron to occupy. Two electrons cannot be at the same point and have the same spin at the same time. It is true, however, that the orbitals occupied by two electrons (even of the same spin) can spatially overlap. But: * These orbitals have to be orthogonal (assuming they are real, the integral of their product over space = 0) The wave function of the n-electron system has to be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons. What this means in practice is that if you take two points in space, r1 and r2, and calculate the probability of finding (say) a spin-up electron at r1 and another at r2, this probability goes to zero as you make r1 and r2 closer and closer to each other. If you do this for electrons of opposite spins, you will get a non-zero probability. Now, indeed, if you include a treatment of electron interactions and correlations (which goes beyond OP's orbital-filling scheme), you would see a cusp, or sharp minimum, in the latter probability, at r1=r2. [The graph](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/chem341/raddis2.gif) tells you the probability of finding an electron as a function of distance. As labelled, each line represents different orbitals. You'll find that the radial distribution function of the 1s orbital has 1 hump - that is, there is some maximum probability of finding an electron at some distance from the nucleus. The 2s orbital has 2 humps, with the bigger one further away from the nucleus than the 1s. However, you'll find that it has a tiny hump that is completely overlaps the 1s. That tells you, therefore, that in that particular region of space, you'll have non-zero probability of finding 1s and 2s electrons. It's as common as you see electrons in those orbitals. In other words, in any elements from lithium and heavier, you'll have orbital overlap in the ground state. In even simpler terms - it's ubiquitous. so when they intersect that means they have the same probability of being in the same place at a specific time? The points of intersection in the graphs isn't the important parts. The important parts is that for any given distance, there is non-zero probability of finding electrons in more than one orbitals. If orbitals are spatially exclusive, at any given point in space there should be probability of finding an electron in _only one_ orbital, and the probability distribution functions of all other orbitals would be zero at that but that's not the case. What actually what does it mean that there's a probability that the electron will be there? Say 90% probability of being there at x distance, so if I check every second for 100 seconds there would be 90 times where I can see the electron? > Say 90% probability of being there at x distance , so if I check every second for 100 seconds there would be 90 times where I can see the electron? Keep in mind though that the probabilities are integrated over volumes - so it would be something akin to checking this volume of space for the presence of the electron. What are the rules in a covalent bond then? I thought that atoms snapped together and the valence electron would fill the orbital of the bonded atom. Does this really happen or is it a dumbed down model?

Iron bound oak towered almost twelve feet overhead, flanked by two torches with flames burning lazily in their sconces. *The pyromancers never stood a chance*. He wiped sweat from his brow as the image of the dying men burned into his mind. *We should have been more prepared. If only we had more time*. There was no time for remorse though; he had a king to face. Usually the thought of having to face the king would terrify Padraig, but tonight he\u2019d rather take his chances with his majesty than have to face the undead hoard that were scaling the castle walls. He looked back at the Great Hall. Once the central social hub of the inner keep, tonight it housed hundreds of frightened women and children, sheltered from the violence outside. Mothers tried to hush their crying babies while others prayed for the gods to save them. The sound of weeping and frail lament filled the air, but it did nothing to drown out the cries of the dead and dying from outside across the moat. Two young boys were playing dice beneath a portrait of St. Lorcan. *They are faring much better than those who were sought refuge in the cathedral*, Padraig reminded himself. The thought struck his heart and weakened his knees. I should have stayed with you. I think the story would benefit from describing the main characters feelings more. Before the mention of the undead I had no idea there was some sort of crisis or stress going on. I also thought the place was desolate, from the lack of sounds being described. Because there's no descriptions telling you how Padraig feels, you get the picture that he isn't feeling much. Consider removing almost from the second sentence. Your prose will gleam if it's more decisive. Of course, there's always exceptions, as there are to every rule. Describe how the pyromancers died instead of merely telling us. This will make Padraig's emotional response more powerful and evocative. Your prose has great rhythm, and your grammar is solid. Rhythm is something I strive for, and omitting that almost' adds nice alliteration to the second line. I'll fiddle around with the second point when it comes to the re-write. Later on in the scene, I do describe the deaths, but I'll try to add even a little bit more to this part, if it helps invoke the imagery earlier. I think the sentence Usually the thought... could benefit from taking out having to face as you have recently mentioned that phrase Love the image of the undead hoard scaling the castle walls. Which makes me think, there is a bit of urgency in this passage? So what do you think of changing the word 'lazily' refering to the torches. If it was a bit more dynamic you could hint at the atmosphere right there?

I didn't see the 600/800 gold daily in a long time. At the start I did get them pretty often, but now it's 200 or 300 all the time for 2 weeks already (with majority of 200, sadly). Dailies should have some sort of rotation. Or at least be random, but they can't repeat until you get all of them. E.g. if you did the 2 Starcraft hero games daily, next time you get a random one excluding this one. Next time you get Win 3 games daily and when you finish it, you can't get neither 2 SC games nor Win 3 games - you get the random one from the rest of the pool. Until you get the last quest, then it resets and every quest goes back to the pool. The gold Reward should be from 400 to 600g instead of 200 to 800g. Blizzard really wants me to play Diablo characters Same here!!! wait you can get 800g from a SINGLE daily? I've been playing since technical alpha at least 3 times a week and I've NEVER seen anything over 300g You mean the start of the technical alpha in march or just before the closed beta 2 weeks ago? At least before the closed beta patch, we had confirmed 3 quests for 200g, 4x300g, 1x600g and 1x800g. Ive been playing since like october last year when it was in alpha, never seen the 600 or 800 ones, granted not every single day but once or twice a week at least Twice a week over 4 months should be ~34 quests. you're welcome I agree as far as that random seems to be a tough concept to understand for many people, and that many feel betrayed by the RNG if they don't land on the lucky side of small sample sizes.

Subreddit: reddevils I don't think they work like that. It is usually a certain amount X of money each year, for Y numbers of years. I guess you could say they could be part of future transfers, but it is mostly all of them adding up together that add to the budget, not the individial one. Even if a Norwegian fish company wants to sponsor 30 mill \u00a3 over 10 years, it only gives you 3 mill per year. I only base this off Football Manager, so take it with a grain of salt. Quiet possibly there'll be cash up front, but you're absolutely right. It'll be dripped in over a number of years. I think the flurry of new sponsors is a result of the business side of the club really pushing the 'brand' while we're on top. They would, in all likelihood, have had an inkling SAF was nearing or at least considering retirement and they would have been working on these deals for quite a while It's going to be unbelievably tough for Moyes (or anyone) to replicate what Fergie did in terms of trophies, which means that the prestige and the value of the club to sponsors is unlikely to rise and is relatively a lot more likely to fall. So it makes a lot of business sense to lock all these sponsors in on long term deals now. To be clear, I think Moyes is a great hire and, as a club, we'll be fine, but it's a great move to secure the financial future of the club for the next few years just in case Moyes takes longer to settle in than we'd hope and we have to survive a few lean years on the pitch - and the subsequent reduction in prize and TV money. Possibly but you never know, the money is there, Moyes is probably working behind the scenes to bring in players and isn't having much success. These sponsorships will help massively next year though, especially that Chevrolet one. The club are ALWAYS looking to bring in as much money as they possibly can. They may not know who Moyes is right now. We're a club in debt. Maybe we're just trying to get rid of it so we can spend like the other big clubs in the future or maybe we're looking for a big buy now. Our debt is actually not a hindrance to our spending. We have healthy debt since our revenue more than covers our repayment plan. The recent Forbes valuation was in excess of $3B, which far exceeds any outstanding debts. That's also before the Chevy deal kicks in and before what will eventually be a record Nike kit deal. Nobody wants to join us - none of the big stars know who Moyes is! I'm sure that no one has ever heard of that Scottish lad who manages that team in manc that's best in England or sumfink or nuffin I live in Germany and most people's response to the news Moyes was the new coach was who?! I would imagine many players (who're often idiots lets make that clear) thinking they'd rather play for Mourihno, Guardiola et al. The people in Germany aren't stars.

Is there an easy way to do this? Is there some instruction I can add that will break the cache every time? I use a version file for cache busting. For example, Jenkins builds most of my images and our build scripts look something like: git describe --tags --long --dirty --always In the Dockerfile an ADD version /foo/version is inserted wherever you would like the cache busted. A common place is after the dependencies / libraries are installed. The first encountered ADD instruction will invalidate the cache for all following instructions from the Dockerfile if the contents of <src> have changed. This includes invalidating the cache for RUN instructions. See the Dockerfile Best Practices guide for more information. Looks useful. It's possible there's a better solution to your problem than guaranteeing a cache invalidation. I am cloning the tarball of a private git repo and for some reason it always is getting cached. I'm looking for an easy way to invalidate right before I download it. I will look at doing it via the ADD command but was having trouble authenticating to the repo in the past. Another idea is to set an environment variable using `ENV` to invalidate the cache. It adds a layer but works: ``` ENV cachebust-1434316717 ``` In this case, I just set the number of be Unix epoch time. Add/take away a hash after the command I'm not 100% happy with this solution, since it has to make a remote call to a server, but in my scripts I place an ADD line to a URL which returns a random string, thus ensuring it will always fail checksum validation. The ideal solution for me would be a local file which has dynamic behaviors. Second best would be a local mini web-server providing this to the docker build.

Lighting is going to be so much more important than the camera. Any compact camera made in the last 8 years will be more than sufficient far as image quality goes, but you need external lights. So if you are on a budget, get the cheapest compact camera with a proper hotshoe that you can find (an older Canon G-series would be my first idea), and get a couple of strobes and stands with the rest of the money. $500 would be a good start?"", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

I just dont feel that musically connected to many games these days (with the notable exception of Super Meat Boy and Team Fortress 2).

Subreddit: golf Been thinking about picking up arccos but don't want to draw the ire of the eye of sauron (the missus). I'm currently using hole 19 but would love to be able to track my shots and club selection to run some numbers on them. Does anyone have any recommendations (ios or android)? I love the Game Golf app. It allows you to track your club distances with GPS using just your phone. You have to get your phone out before every shot, but that's not so bad because I need to do that for yardages anyway. I played around with it while at home but couldn't really get a sense for how easy it is to use w/o being on the actual course w/ the GPS on. The GPS is usually pretty spot on. Sometimes I have issues with selecting the tees and it tags my drives at different tee markers. I played a few rounds last week and guy I played with had a range finder and I was usually within 3 yards of his measurements. I walk the course with my Clicgear and have the iPhone in a (cheap Chinese) craddle mounted on the cart handle. I find tagging on the iPhone screen as easy as tagging to a belt device. And the app doubles as rangefinder too. I am cheap and use Swing by Swing. You click 3 times to track, once for track, once for club, and once to stop it. It tracks your swings, tells you hole yardages, etc... and has some of the smaller courses on it. Been using it 2-3 years and best of all- it's free. I'll second this it's a great reference tool. Get the game golf with tags. Not the live version. Just game golf classic. Its amazing. And you dont have to use an app or your phone. How accurate do you find the shot tracking? Do you end up editing shots after the round? First off GG is the most trans formative thing I have found in years. If you are a 20 hcp your prob better served by taking lessons than getting this because you just aren't making solid contact. I was prob a 6-7 hcp when I got it and I would maybe have one bad shot per round. Now I can see where i lose strokes and i use that for focusing practice. I had bad shots typically between 40-60 yards and 150-175 so I focus more on those now and less on driving. I also used it to validate club changes. I changed drivers and gained 24 yards while going from 55% to 53% FIR. Which i can live with for 24 more yards. You will inevitably have to edit something each round but the interface is fantastic. I only use it on PC though (have the app for reference). There is only one thing i love and hate at the same time. If you stop for a period of time it will tag you at that shot automatically. Which is great for when you forget to tag, because this remembers your shot and you just have to add the club. but yesterday we were playing with a senior and we stopped at every red tee. I had to go back and delete all the stops at the red tees. Might have taken 60 seconds to delete them all. Pretty sure just gps via your phone. Im not touching my phone on the course While YMMV, I find that people using these sorts of apps are also the people who play too slowly. I tend to look up yardages on my phone (I have poor depth perception) so if I could quickly enter my club choice while doing so, I don't think I'd slow things down too much. I do agree though and hate being that guy, which is why I was leaning toward a tagging system of some kind to speed things up, but I've spent enough on gear this season. Arccos I don't believe you have to select the club you are hitting so I can save a little scratch. I'm very tempted by Arccos and how hands-off It can slow you down. I have it where I can get a yardage and tag my shots within about 10 seconds of getting near my ball. I don't need to know that it is 167 exactly So I'll hit my 170 club. Put my bag down tag my shot while getting my club out. I'm biased because I'm the developer, but check out Pattern Golf\u2122. There is a free version to give you a taste of the paid version if you want to try it out. It's iOS only, though, at the moment. Android version coming in the future. I'm pretty sure that hole19 has the ability to track shots and clubs used - [Advanced Input](https://hole19.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202457122-Advanced-Input-shot-by-shot-tracking-) I primarily use an Android which doesn't have this feature yet, but I'll try it out next time I'm playing w/ an iPhone handy! I have been using it for a while before I got gps watch, but I think it is quite useful. It has a shot measurement function which will show the average distances for the clubs. It looks the arccos system is going for 140-200 on eBay, so it should be relatively OK price-wise. GameGolf is going for $130 and lower, so you should be able to squeeze that in. I use the arccos, but the systems look to be pretty equivalent. The arccos website is pretty good at stats, though it doesn't really deal with non-full shots well.

Kinda annoyed farming end game content and low and behold my ult makes them go out of its range deadpool's ult is Server Lag that basically stuns or lags all mobs on the screen EXCEPT for bosses. Funny thing is RR ulti will hold mobs in place even bosses. so for a range class its basically a stun and last about one minute. I wonder who designed these ults some are completely useless. Aside the actual usability of deadpool's ult, I actually find the whole idea of deadpool's normal breaking of the 4th wall hilarious. the ult is hilariously exactly what deadpool would do, just bad implementation. yeah, best wombo combo I've seen is RR and cyclops. RR for the hold and cyclops just melts any boss (even group bosses) in seconds. Fun to watch until you start thinking about how useless your own ult is. Deadpool's working on it (it doesn't work on bosses, yet). I wouldn't be surprised if it does work on bosses eventually. and it does so little damage, you can do the same amount of damage with a few might smashes or avalanche leap and destructive mayhem.

Subreddit: lakers Sac wouldn't trade him for just the pick Agreed, we'd have to throw in a couple more assets to sweeten the pot In a SECOND! If it means giving up Randle I don't want to have to rely heavily on Demarcus. He's already proven that he's not someone who can carry a franchise on his own. I watched a whole lot of Sacramento games this year and the guy just doesn't have his head on straight sometimes. When he's locked in, he's one of the best big men in the game. But he shoots himself in the foot too many times with bone-headed plays and emotional angst. When he has his head on straight he is the BEST big man in the game In a heartbeat. Cousins is a beast and is getting more beastly every year. i would do it instantly and throw in the second if they asked as well. but sac won't do this, cousins is young and proven star that will likely be a superstar in the coming years Coming years? Cousins is already the best center in the NBA and a top 10 player. He is a superstar! I would and none of the top two big men will have the career cousins will have. You couldn't possibly know that. It's very possible they could both be better both be worse or one be better and one not. There is a reason that people who get paid to evaluate players are salivating over these two bigs. That said I would do the trade in a second. Assuming we could add enough talent for the cousins acquisition to put us in win now mode. Acquiring boogie would at least take the pick and Clarkson or Randle if not both. I don't think it's worth it all of that at this moment unless we made a big splash in free agency. Really don't get the hard on this sub Put it his way we'll be lucky if we pick a guy who turns out as good as cousins already is in five years. 25-12 guy (and young) for potential 20-10 guy Eh I would say 20 and 10 is pretty much a guarantee from okafor. Whether he ends up being al Jefferson or the next great center or something between remains to be seen but it seems to be the consensus that his floor is al Jefferson. He is the best center in the game and he is what 24 maybe 25. I wouldn't do it though, I don't think he is going to put this team over the top and the 2 pick wouldn't be enough. We would have to send Clarkson or Randle with it and possibly both. If we were to sign a big time free agent then I would be more open to doing it. Much bigger contract than our pick would have also. 15 mill for a top 10 player? A big man who can bring up the ball, pass like pau, shoot elbow jumpers like ibaka, and work his way around the post. If anything his contract is the best part I'd take it in a heartbeat because you are a laker fan Would you guys trade Randle + 27th pick + 2nd pick for DMC + the King's 6th pick? but that makes no sense, why would the Kings add the 6th pick?

Victor is dead and the rest of the crew doesnt seem very charitable so unless there was a monetary benefit this hook would likely just sit there. Hey, what happened to the whole community voting on the job I think Adam could put this video as one of the options. When the PCs were still taking mercenary missions, this was totally a thing. I've moved the mechanism over to Mirrorshades because Swan Song has kind of gone off in a more focused direction. Once they go looking for work, again, I'll be calling on y'all to help! That was mirrorshades i think , which right now seems less sandboxy to me. The awesome thing about Swansong is its a giant sandbox and Adam rarely tries to railroad them into specific things. For example they could decide to go back to that Bug Planet now and kill alll Vad's. He was doing it for Swan Song as well, but recently the missions have sprung up from the narrative so we haven't been needed to make a decision and the fact that a lot of the prepping Adam does resolves into nothing because the crew chooses to go on different missions. Elaborating a whole universe with missions, stories and events where the players can feel that they're part of their own adventure instead of a linear narrative is hard. Though I aprecciate the contribution, I dont believe it would be possible to do in a game like Swan Song. Maybe if there were something like this on West Marches it could be interesting Its well made and cool, but Victor is dead and the group aren't really much of a charity group :P maybe Pi will force them into it because she/he/it liked him.

Worth it? It's worth it. Any time you can get games for $2-$3 a piece, and you know one of the video games is worth $50, then you've got a good deal. You could keep an eye on this to find out. That has a day left, and it's already at $17 with 6 bids. Chances are it doubles at least in the next day, knowing Ebay auctions... I'd say chances are good that it's worth around $50. My experience, yes it is worth it. The game can be pretty tough to get a hold of. If someone had it and wanted $50 for it, I probably wouldn't buy it, because I like to try to hold out and get a good deal, but it is worth it, IMO. The 21 games (including the 76-1) plus the controllers is a very good deal. You would be silly to pass it up. It's a bootleg with pirated roms on it.

Now that that's out of the way, 21 games for $50 sounds fair The way I always look at is this. Every sports game equal 0$. Know your prices for the sports games that are actually fun. Then every game that you know of is worth 2$. Every game you do not now is 1$. Then factor in known prices for accessories and if the added up price for that is more then what you are paying then chances are that it is worth it. I will go out on the limb and say that it is probably worth it. Even if you trade out that 76-in-1 for another game you want to one of us. List of games? Keep in mind that eBay usually (not always) pulls down multicarts that are obviously bootlegs. A compilation cart with that many games usually spells disaster.

My TouchID would unlock my iPhone 5S (8.1.1) only every other sleep cycle. My first thought was this could be a sensor issue. Since I am jailbroken, I wanted to make sure before I restore and and take it to the Apple Store. So I proceeded to troubleshoot. I removed all TouchID tweaks: VirtualHome 8, ReachAll and ReachApp. At once, my TouchID works perfectly. Unlocking my iPhone every sleep cycle. I tried to isolate the issue to one tweak. It turned out that when any of them is installed, the problem resurfaces. Is anyone having the same problem with those tweaks? I would try to install the latest VH8 beta (if you haven't already) and see if it makes it any better. Also, try to use a different action to invoke Reachability via Activator (instead of the standard Touch ID action), or setup Reachability using VH8, as either of these suggestions may help your setup function better. The latest beta of VH8, available from the repo above, squashes tons of bugs, and works amazingly well for me, but I have an i6 (stock Reachability), & I don't use ReachApp. ReachApp doesn't cause that for me and I uninstalled virtualhome after I emailed the developer twice and he has continued to ignore me despite his automatic reply saying he's going to reply within 48 hours. Or specific to your phone which I assume is a 5S? The beta of VH8 works amazingly well, compared to the current 'stable' release available on the default repos. Try installing from this repo to see if it works better for you also. I'm loving the latest update, and I'm sure there will be another soon, now that the developer has released Twitkafly and is back working on VH8. I hope that works better for you. My issue with it is that the vibration is linked to the ringer vibration. Is this different in the beta? Have you contacted the developer and been ignored too? I don't know how the vibration works, honestly. I do know that he did some fixing specifically to the vibration feature in the latest update, but I have it turned off. I use VH8 so much that I've turned vibration off to save battery, especially since I have the quick unlock feature enabled to never turn off (always ready). I have not tried to contact the developer for any reason, because I haven't had any issues with the tweak, so I can't comment on his communications (or lack thereof?). Did you ask a question, or report a bug? Chances are if you reported a bug and received no reply, it's because he already knew of the bug and was/is working to fix it. If you asked a question, I don't know why he wouldn't reply unless he knows you haven't officially purchased the tweak The developer has an account here on reddit under the name moeseth (I didn't put the /u/ in front You can also try on Twitter with the same user name. I have purchased it but I'm regretting it because I did ask him a question in my email almost 2 weeks ago and again yesterday and both times I got a nice automated email saying he'll get back to you within 48 hours. Im not going to bother contacting him in any other way than the correct way which you always see people saying you should do through Cydia. Then developers wonder why people pirate (some give others a bad rep) Obviously you don't have to say if you don't want to, Was it the question regarding vibration? I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand what you meant when you said it was tied to ringer/vibrate or whatever. I'd be glad to try to give you a hand. I asked him if he can separate the vibration status of his tweak from the phones ringer settings. Essentially a feature(?) request. I see it as a bug but it could be an iOS limitation that can't be avoided. Either way it's unprofessional to have an automated email reply saying you'll reply within 48 hours and not reply (11 days from first email and 1 day since second email). You seem like a really nice guy. So if you disable vibration on your device for notifications/calls it also disables VH's vibration? Yes, that is unprofessional; at least disable the auto-reply if you won't be actually replying. Not sure why the /s was added because in my opinion it is actually unprofessional. The /s was only pertaining to the part after the semi-colon about disabling the auto-reply email. Did you remove the preference files after removing all of them? So that each tweak starts fresh? I have the latest vh along with reachapp I've only just started having this issue (touchID fails to activate approximately half the time) with the most recent Activator update in the past few days, and I have no other touchID-related tweaks installed."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: loseit I'll begin by saying I'm being very serious even though this might sound silly. I have Lexical-Gustatory synesthesia, which means if I hear (or think of) certain words, I get an immediate and involuntary flavor of something (depending on the word). I've always called it having my wires crossed and only semi-recently found out it's a thing. Sometimes the flavors are unpleasant, but more often than not, they're good. Occasionally I'll hear a word and it sticks with me and is the catalyst for a serious craving (for example, I work in a doctors office and the word schedule gives me the flavor of a cinnamon roll). I hear this word countless times per day so it's almost like I can't get the flavor out of my mind sometimes and I just decide to eat it because I can't stop thinking about it. This has been ongoing since childhood, and have a lot of memories of eating and sometimes binging on certain foods because it's almost a relief to get the REAL flavor of the food rather than the phantom flavor. I've also had weight problems my whole life and I truly think this is a contributing factor. I started putting the pieces together as soon as I discovered that there is such a thing as synesthesia. So, does anyone has a similar experience? I'm wondering if someone has any insight on how to deal with something like this effectively. Would it work to have very small portions of the bad food you're craving? If not it sounds like its going to require extra willpower to overcome it, probably not what you want to hear. I agree, I think it comes down to just being able to say no. I've tried eating smaller portions in the past with mixed results but I think that's the only way to manage it. but I remember when I got to a certain point in my dieting where I started dreaming of food. That was tough, waking up having dreamt of eating hamburgers all night. I did that recently with brownies. It's almost worse dreaming about food, the experience is somehow more real and disappointing. Would it work to pop a piece of gum or a mint in your mouth to clear the flavor from your palette? Or do the flavors just co-mingle? That's a great suggestion , I haven't ever tried that when I'm having this particular problem. I do use mints if I'm feeling snacky due to boredom so this could work! I am so sorry this is causing you such trouble, and I really don't mean to turn what is clearly a serious issue into something less important I'm always intrigued by synesthesia Could you perhaps think of, or ask someone to say, a different word which would trigger the inverse reaction, or at least a reaction less difficult to resist than cinnamon rolls? A lot of the time if it happens that I hear a word that sparks a serious craving (which is really only maybe 2-4 times a month) I just try to fight it, but I'll try to direct my attention to some other word haha.

Subreddit: darksouls I was wondering if anyone else is starting off as a deprived, simply for role playing purposes? Is this a terrible idea for a first playthrough? I mean, the game's already going to be challenging enough, but i dunno, i just think it'd be cool starting with almost literally nothing and clawing my way up from scratch. Honestly I have never played Demon's Souls so difficulty wise I'm just going off what I have been told, but I am going to go with Deprived for my first play through for sure. Most all classes give you some sort of help but the deprived just seems the most awesome and challenging so that is what I'm going to do. Largest strength and Endurance. Also comes with a hard hitting axe. The pictures i've seen of the bandit do look pretty badass haha. The deprived is the highest starting level, and 11 across all stats (except of course humanity), which makes him very balanced, I'm not so sure he'll be so hard to play. The Pyromancer is level 1 however, yet still has over 30 distributed skill points, does this make him easier to play or harder? I assume as he's level 1 he'll increase in levels quicker, but as I don't know anything about the starting game yet, it's impossible to say. I think I'll pick the Cleric though, level 2 and good stats, plus I don't believe it's the stats that make the game easier/harder, but more the equipment itself. Doesn't the deprived start with nothing? It would be similar to how the thief was one of the harder starter classes, due to his weapon. Stats do play a fairly important role, but it's not really the individual stats per se , it's the end game of the stats (if you're wanting to equip certain things, or figuring out when you're going to hit the DR's of some stats). is a much more important factor, and obviously your ability to adapt is crucial as well! Starting as a thief was actually pretty powerful because of the extra backstab damage. There were better options of course, but I think barbarian was the most difficult. Absolutely no armor made him extremely quick to die. i'm not too sure on how strong pyromancer will be, but with the way magic is set up now, it seems to deter the Demon's Souls strategy of just building up a glass cannon, since you only get a certain amount of spells per campfire. For the pyromancer, you're just going to end up getting more points in the long run to distribute. Pyro is probably the easiest class to start with though, yes. That early flame spell, decent armor, and weapons will make the first bit of the game a bit more manageable. But as it's been said before, give it about 2 hours of progress in gameplay, and the starting class really doesn't matter. You can do whatever you want from that point. This is what I love about the character classes in Demons Soul's and Dark Souls. You aren't tied down to one class. You can start out one way, but find something that works extremely well and modify your character to your playing needs.

Also, since you are >already doing weighted chins, I'd do your throughout-the-day >bodyweight chins with a variety of grips and widths. If you want to include burpees, I'd use the Viking Challenge from Greyskull as programming. * You goal is a 3 second per burpee pace. * You will perform 3 sets, every morning * Start with 10 reps and 60s rest between the sets * When you hit a 3s/burpee pace in all 3 sets, you add 1 burpee (and 3s) to your set. So start of with 3x10. When you can do each set in 30s with 60s rest, repeat for 3x11 in 33s, 3x12 in 36s, etc all the way up to 3x30 in 90s - at this point, move on 2x31 up to 2x50, then 1x51 up to 1x100. The end goal is to be able to do 100 burpees straight in 5 minutes or less. And being from Sweden, the Viking name appeals a lot :p How often should I do this? And if I do this, maybe the other pushups would be to much. I would pick one thing to do outside of normal workouts. Use the other stuff as your warmup for your actual workout. The viking challenge is done every day, without a rest day. Scale it as you need to not feel terrible. I just won't have the time. I would slightly reorder this so you can superset the exercises (set of A1, rest 90s, set of A2, rest 90s, set of A1, etc).

I did a bit of looking and didn't find much advice for second cards so let me lay it out. My first credit card was through my local credit union. I got a very good APR, all things considered. I did good with it at first, but then my fiance lost his job. I'm sure you can imagine what happened next in the months he was unemploymed. Ended up with about $2k on that card, no other debt between the two of us. We're down to $1.5k and are paying 3x the minimum payment every month (~$100 I think). We just finished paying a relative for our vehicle and we are going to have some extra cash(several hundred) every month. I would ideally like to get a second card, transfer a portion of the balance to take advantage of a balance transfer promotion, and pay both down concurrently.

Is this possible and what card should I look at? I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns. Chase Slate is often recommended for this. Not sure if you'd get it with your high utilization though. Chase is fairly picky. Yeah, we're at 1500 out of a 2400 limit and it's definitely not peachy. Credit Karma did say my odds of getting accepted to a different Chase card were very good, but I'm not exactly putting all my faith in that. Plus I'd hate to apply, not get it, and ding my score. Chase freedom was the card CK recommended. Yep, whats the APR on the current card? I think it's 19% but it could be 22%. I'll go check and see if I can find it online. Apparently it's currently 13.9%. 1500 $208.50 in interest per year or ~$17 a month. It's not terrible, but you really should never pay interest on your credit card. Get that thing paid off. But I think I could save myself some interest if I can transfer a portion of that to another card with a promotional 0% for balance transfer. I know whatever amount I transfer will be paid off within the promo time(I won't transfer the whole balance) it will help with dropping my credit utilization quicker, and I'll have a slightly more balanced report than just one credit card with 1500 on it. I'd like to have a card that earns rewards so I can use it for gas and hotels, so that's another thing I'm wanting, but it's a lower priority. - Do you have a home loan or car loan application coming up? If not, do not worry about utilization. - The good rewards cards require good credit. Five or six months if we put every penny extra towards it. No loans coming in our future. That's why it's a low priority for me. I know my credit is nothing special. Your credit is very important, but the utilization aspect of it is only important if you need new forms of credit. I'd go ahead and try to pay it off in the 5 months and be done with it. I just meant my score is nothing special.

Apologies if the answer seems very obvious, but I'm a little out of my element. Any other suggestions/recommendations are much appreciated. For the record, my friend went DLP (I was asking on his behalf). Some of the more critical responses came after he had placed the order. If anyone is interested, I will update this thread I'm sure someone searching for advice will come across this. I would not recommend DLPs or Plasmas. You want an LCD or better. Plasmas and DLPs suffer from high cost replacement parts. If your bulb wears out. Plasmas can suffer from burn-in as well. DLPs suffer from lack of color saturation and the saturation will change over time. Your best bet is to go with LCD (or LCD w/ LED backlit). Newer plasmas do not suffer burn in. I would deffinitly go with the plasma over the dlp. As for plasmas vs lcd (led) its all about preference. In my ecperience plasmas offer much deeper blacks while lcds have vibrant whites. I prefer plasmas because of on average the refresh rates are 10 times better. 60hz vs 600. I own both a plasma and lcd and my newer lcd suffers from slow down while watching sports. Ah, didn't know they fixed the burn in issues. The picture quality of the Plasma is way above DLP IMO. have you seen these screens in person? keep in mind that if you're on a budget, the rest of the 3D accessories for the DLP (or any 3D setup) cost a bundle too. It's not all about size, I have a 52 LCD and if anything its a little too big for my living room. If you're going to be watching movies definitely go plasma. I don't have anything good to say about DLP except that the technology is cool. i'll admit they do look pretty good straight on, but that only satisfies 1 viewer :/ My DLP experience is similar to yours. I've got a 50 inch Akai that has served me well The picture quality (especially the blacks) are subpar compared to the plasma screens I've seen. The plasma TVs are crazy cheap right now. I've had a 1080p 57 Mitsubishi DLP for about 3 years; I love it! I watch blu-rays on it and they look amazing. Definitely do not regret purchasing it. About 3 months after purchasing the TV I got some error on screen (it was still running though) and I googled it, and came up with an overheating issue being the cause. Called Mitsubishi, they told me to expect someone at the house at 8am. 7:45am there is a knock on my door and two guys are there holding a new TV. By 8:05 they were gone and the new TV was fully hooked up. As an additional bit of info, the bulb lasted me till whenever the winter olympics where on earlier this year. So, for heavy TV watchers (1-3hrs a night between the family members) + the Wii/360... almost 3 year bulb life... I'd say we got ~5000 hours out of the bulb. Can't say anything about the LG \u2014 not a fan of the plasmas in general, great quality typically (blacks are truer for a start, typically), but I'd rather have an LED if I wanted to go thin.

As another post notes, you have to lose weight all over. 80% of weight loss is due to diet, so you can continue whatever you're doing to make you big and strong and you'll lose weight by reducing your caloric intake. Work in construction so i think diet is key. My gut didn't go away overnight but it quit looking bloated after two weeks of [/r/keto](/r/keto) and now I just look fat, not like I have a balloon in my shirt. The fat loss will take a while, although I am making progress fairly quickly. I work in construction (12hour, long, gruelling days) and just wondered, if i started this keto plan would i lose energy from not having many carbs? Honestly, the first few days you might feel fatigued but my energy levels for long term working have never been better. I would advise lowering the carbs during the afternoon for a week or two then going full keto on the last workday before a long weekend. Although it really isn't necessary to go full keto to see benefits from lowering your carbs. Keto is just faster (and makes me feel more alert and awake). The only way to a flat belly is fat loss. To look shredded, try a low carb diet to reduce your body fat. r/keto is great for advice. There are lots of guys over there who can help with Lean gains, and targeted carbing for great workouts while losing that last bit of stubborn body fat. what went into your mouth put the fat on your stomach and what goes in your mouth will take it off. Diet is the key. You cant target fat burn. ANY exercise will burn fat faster than your natural body burning fat, but the fat comes off in the reverse order it was put on. If the last thing that got fat was your belly, that will be the first place you will notice weight loss. Most of weight loss is done by diet, exercise helps a bit, but I would do that after you reach your target weight or fat loss to tone up/endurance. What is the best exercises to lose the gut that doesnt involve jogging, swimming or cycling? When you get hungry walk from the couch to the refrigerator. Smack yourself repeatedly for eating too much. Return to the couch. Repeat as needed. Check out the r/fitness FAQ, as well as the FAQ here. Everyone else here is right when they say you can't spot reduce. It's only +muscle, -fat, and to do that you have to cut your calorie intake. Track what you eat, lift if you want to build muscle on your stomach. Other than that, not much you can do."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Score: 1 This is a fantastic production, period. I saw Angela Lansbury and George Hearn in 1980, and this production holds its own against the original. What a cast! The limitations imposed by the space make this production's accomplishment all the more admirable. The reduction of James Lapine's orchestrations once more -- now down to a trio led by piano -- was really impressively done, and so well played. Score: 3 Saw Norm Lewis, Carolee Carmello, Brad Oscar, Jamie Jackson et al and the show was unforgettably wonderful. I have seen many productions, including the original, and this one is up there with the greats. Don't cheat yourself of an experience for the ages. Score: 4 Once again, Mr. Brantley fails theater goers with his tepid review. We saw this last night and were blown away by it. Loved Norm Lewis, Carolee Carmello and the cast. Score: 0 Just saw this last night with Norm Lewis as Sweeney. What a gift he is in the role! Score: 1 Saw it last might for the third time. What a spectacular complement to the original production (which I also saw, coincidentally, three times). No production I've seen in the intervening years has come close to translating the incredible drama and score so effectively. This version probably could not have succeeded as well 40 years ago - it's really a production for those who love Sweeney Todd revere the story and song, which is not to say it can't be enjoyed by a first-time viewer. But it presents the piece in a thrillingly theatrical way. AND - the integration of the incredible score is made more apparent by the wonderful reduced orchestration, which relies principally upon the piano - what a thrill to hear the drama played on that instrument so magnificently. I'm sorry the four British members of the cast have concluded their engagement. her voice is outstanding and she plays both the Bigger Woman and Perrilli with charm, grace and full comic turns intact. She is one to look for in the future ... loved all the performances including that Barber... but lets not forget about his wife This was my 7th production and I loved it. It's a lot of fun to see it in such a different and in-your-face way. The pie shop setting is amusing and when the play starts, nothing feels false at all. In this intimate room and with only 3 players in the band tucked into one corner, you hear every word (which was kind of a revelation given that I already know every word by heart). We already have tickets for later in the run to go back and see the great Norm Lewis after he takes over the role. And *definitely* get a pie - they are each pretty special. Score: 4 Can't agree with the moderate tone of this review. i thought this production was splendid. Score: 6 Don't Walk. This is a truly magical production. Score: 7 Brilliant intimate production in a recreated London pie shop with a talented cast and clever trio. Having the marvelous pies before the show started only increased anticipation. Such joy, such clear Sondheim, those musical numbers making such sense. This was the production I have always dreamed of and cannot wait to see it again. We saw this production today (Saturday matinee) No one was yelling, everyone is singing. The singing and acting are first rate. Tiny theater with about 130 seats provides for a very intimate and riveting experience. And yes - pre order the meat pies. They were great. Score: 6 One of my all-time favorites - seen it a few times - the film many times A turntable set with the barber shop and the ovens would perfect the production, space and funds clearly would not allow for that. Loved that the fourth wall was broken down, wonderful singing and truly gifted tiny orchestra. By all means Sondheim lovers, you need to see this imaginative Sweeney. Score: 7 Shakes head, eye roll.

Ms Finke was fabulous, Mr Secomb owned the room with his eyes, the rest of the cast absolute perfection. It was simply put a marvelous evening in the theater. RUN to get tickets if you can. And by all mean get the pies they were sensational as baked by Bill Yossess ex White House Pastry chef. Score: 15 Don't put stock in Mr. Brantley's somewhat jaded review. Go see it for yourself. This production is innovative, intriguing, beguiling, heartbreaking, and entrancing in equal measure. The singers and musicians are incredible and when you leave the show you have no doubt about their great talent and commitment to making this an outstanding project. This production is guaranteed to capture your full attention, long after you leave the show. Score: 6 I thought Mrs. Lovett was fantastic, probably the best part of the production. Also the meat pies had tiny chicken in them so there was no visceral reaction to the irony - and they were incredible! Score: 13 With all due respect, while reading this review I kept thinking, was this the same production I just saw???? My husband and I along with another couple, were totally blown away by the Barrow Street production and would see it again in a heartbeat! I have to say I think you missed out on how pure and wonderful a show this production really is. Maybe you should go back, not as a reviewer but as a member of the audience, with a whole other set of eyes, ears, and open to another kind of experience. Score: 15 Could not disagree more with Mr. Brantley's (frankly jaded) assessment of this production. Unlike him, I haven't seen eight different productions, so maybe I don't have the expert's eye that he does. But I found plenty of nuance in this presentation - the scaled-down orchestra, the creative use of the limited space available to intensify the atmosphere, the willingness to reach out and make those in attendance more than just spectators. How can he not feel Ms. McCarthy's love for the character of Mrs. Lovett? This was one of the top theatrical experiences I've had in New York, all the way down to the (delicious) pies. Go see it, if you can get tickets, and take Mr. Brantley's sour, joyless assessment with a hefty helping of jellied eels. Score: 1 Probably better retitled The Demon Barber of Barrow Street, mai no? Score: 5 I saw the original Sweeney starring Angela Lansbury and was unimpressed. The audience gave her a standing ovation. The best Sweeney I've seen is the movie, Tim Burton's masterpiece with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. They bring out the pitch-black humor of the piece. He's obsessed with revenge. She's obsessed with him. The rest of the brilliant cast bring every character to brooding, bloody life. The degree of difficulty in making a musical about a serial killer could not be higher. They pull it off, my friends. Score: 2 Did the show design itself? No credits? Great and minimal set design - you really get the feeling you're in a grimy pie shop. Great use of candles for lighting - moody and eerie. Stage choreography effective and interactive. Excellent fight choreography too. Score: 9 After seeing many productions of Sweeney, including the original with Len Cariou and Bernadette Peters, think the Tooting Arts Club production is totally riveting. totally mad, not played safely. Ms. McCarthy's Mrs Lovett is played as a true loon; her performance of By the Sea revels in her madness. The confines of the theater make the play all the more intense and it is stunning. The set is pure Hogarth. The misery, the poverty, the sadness are there for the audience to see. One of the evening in the theater that will stay in my memory forever. Score: 6 Hard to believe that anyone who saw the original production would think Bernadette Peters played Mrs. Lovett. Angela Lansbury owned the part. Score: 2 Bernadette Peters as Mrs. Lovett? Maybe she ended up in a pie before she opened. If you're old enough to have seen it, you're entitled to a senior moment. I am seeing it tonight and looking forward to it."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

I hope to visit there on a planned trip to Spain soon. Score: 1 Spent 34 days in Spain and Portugal in September, only ate in an indoor restaurant a few times. First was the hotel in Denia that has very good meals and once on Barcelona on a day when we came back from Girona and there was a thunderstorm, so ate in the Hotel Catalonia where we could watch it from the top floor restaurant. In Faro Portugal the breakfast in the Faro hotel was fine for us, and one other time had breakfast in the Petit Palace hotel on Calle Mayor. The rest of the time it was sidewalk cafes, loved the fresh seafood salads, and paella. We do not travel to eat, we eat to travel. Three hours to savor fancy little dishes, we spent that time in the Picasso Museum. no need for fancy food in Valencia, better time spent at the beach. Besides we became addicted to gelado, would walk to the nearest store in the evening, have one and watch the kids playing in the placa. Score: 3 The one sentence in the article that intrigues and attracts me: \u201cBut the worst would be indifference.\u201d Otherwise, god save me from the creativity of modern cuisine. Score: 1 I found a different sentence interesting, this one: Others are gorgeously simple: a Raf tomato cut in half, with one cream made of the red part and another of the green, poured separately into the same bowl. Unless, of course, when you cut a Raf tomato in half in Spain it turns into cream! In any case, of course, there's simply no way at all that this dish is simple. Score: 2 Nowhere does it say the tomato turns into cream. It says that a cream is made of the tomato; I think one would be safe to assume that other ingredients are involved as well. It doesn't sound simple by any means, but it's a perfectly grammatical sentence. Score: 10 If you find yourself in Barcelona do give Enigma a try , I am certain it will be wonderful. However, why anyone would head to Barcelona for cuisine when there is Madrid, with more to offer on all cultural fronts, is a mystery to me. As they say, De Madrid al Cielo!

I wouldn't pay that much for anything in Madrid either. Score: 2 Barcelona has more to offer in all fronts than Madrid , that's the reason the turistic visits to Barcelona are three times than Madrid. With more history, more modern, closer in all aspects to Europe. The number of Michelin Starred restaurants of Barcelona Area double Madrid ones, but if you prefer an oily Squid Sandwich, Madrid is your city. Score: 0 There seems to be a lot of hatin' on Madrid here. Both places have something uniquely different from each other to offer. Madrid is a city. Barcelona is a beach town/city.

Score: 0.0 But, it was flat. Ms. Vogel said in an interview that she wanted to juxtapose the alleged 'indecency' of Sholem Asch's play with the real indecency of 1920s America -- virulent antisemitism, rise of the KKK, censorship of speech, etc. It would have been a great play with obvious resonance to today had she been able to draw that contrast. However, she did not. The themes of America's indecency were touched upon only gently, minimally, and tangentially. Score: 4.0 I saw the play last night, and I must say, it was performed with great passion in one of the best ensemble performances I've seen in quite some time. This is a show that SHOULD be playing for a longer period than three-plus months. It is beautifully directed (kudos to Tony-winner Ms. Taichman) and acted by a wonderfully talented cast, and deserves to have a long life, even if not on Broadway. Our jaded audiences need to support a show such as Indecent. Score: 3.0 I saw this production yesterday afternoon. beautifully acted and directed. If you haven't seen it, do so before its closing on August 6th. Score: 5.0 Kudos to the producers for deciding to keep Indecent open- - even after a closing notice had been posted for today (6/25). It will now stay OPEN THROUGH AUGUST 6TH due to their brave and almost unprecedented decision. I attended last night's performance and found it so moving and so well directed. The theater was full- - orchestra, mezzanine, AND balcony, and the wonderfully talented cast received a standing ovation. This show is true art. If you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself a favor and vindicate the producers' decision to extend it so that more people could see it before it closed. You won't be disappointed. Score: 3.0 Saw the show last Friday and thoroughly enjoyed it for its commentary on art, integrity, and marginalized groups. It has been a while since I saw a Broadway show without a false note, and this cast is superb. Nelis and Lenk were standouts to me, but the entire ensemble is praiseworthy. The show is earnest, yes, but that felt refreshing to me. It doesn't posture. Its themes are clear and repeated in patterns, but it felt like the cycle of mistakes that human flaws lead to. The staging is deceptively simple but effective, and it felt like college theatricality in the best sense possible. glad the run will continue so others may as well. Score: 0.0 Intelligent, but declamatory and expository, not dramatic. I saw it Saturday, just before the Tonys. It was playing to about 33% capacity. It's been well under 50% for weeks. What's the message? It's this: when it comes to viewers' actually personal money and time, highbrow reviews mean almost nothing and word of mouth means everything. Sorry to be the one to note the huge number of empty seats. Score: 4.0 Saw it on 6/22 - house was completely full. The roaring standing ovation was silenced, temporarily, when Richard Topl announced it was remaining open. Another roar ensued. Terrific play - definitely worth seeing. Score: 2.0 Indecent was magnificently staged beautifully acted, but it did not bring me to tears as it did to so many others. In fact, it did not touch my heart at all. but this show never touched that part of my heart. Yes, there are lots of songs. They're theatrical, and they establish the changing periods, but they stop the story dead in its tracks repeatedly. The songs are basically filler, and the story itself is very thin. Without the songs, the play would have been an hour, which is just about right. Halfway through, the main character seems to disappear from the plot, and towards the end, the play seems to be about another character who was relatively minor. Suddently it's all his play. Towards the end, when the playwright has obviously run out of new things to say, she reverts to some tried and true references and depictions that never fail to wrench the hearts of some audience members. What is it with real rainstorms in the theater these days. It was new and exciting in Kenneth Branagh's Macbeth. Surprising in A View From The Bridge. Unnecessary in The Glass Menagerie. And completly gratuitous in Indecent. Again, they were running out of new things to say so brought out some theatrical tricks to fill out the evening. Saw the play last night. Many -- including my date -- were dissolved in tears. A great deal of artifice goes into assuring us Vengeance is a great play, but it is seldom staged and Asch never wrote another -- is it great or is it just that its onstage lesbianism was unprecedented? Lemml, an obvious playwright's device with no life other than to be a stage manager, says the play changed his life, but he seems never to have worked on any other play for the next forty years. And other details stuck out. We are compelled (since we do not know the play) to accept Vogel's judgment that Vengeance is a supreme masterpiece. If it is, why does no one put it on? Why is Asch largely forgotten? Is she making a mountain out of a molehill? Her play is good but not overwhelming -- I resist art that relies on our knowing about the Holocaust to make its effect. Brilliant production, brilliant acting, the titles are where we can all read them and their commentary is acrid and wise. But the play did not affect me deeply. It did make me want to read God of Vengeance. Score: 5.0 I saw the play last night. This is one of the best plays I have seen in a very long time. Historic, yet much about our current political landscape. So well acted, sets, costumes- everything was wonderful. Run to the Cort theatre!!!! It is indecent not to have given this well designed play a more rousingly positive review. The wonderful chemistry of the ensemble endears all of the characters to your heart and makes you truly believe in them and their passion for their craft and the play that sustains and elevates them. A truly moving and important play you definitely will not want to miss. The night I saw Indecent, people all around me wept, and with good reason. Score: 4.0 Saw Indecent tonight. It does help that I recently saw the Yiddish version of God of Vengeance, which was fabulous. Nevertheless, this shorter play does pack a heavy punch, especially as it picks up steam. Score: 6.0 I saw Indecent in an early preview. After the show I went home and immediately bought a ticket to see it the following week. It was the most imaginative, exhilarating and inspiriting production The actors were some of the most talented I\u2019ve seen on stage, people who could sing, dance, play instruments, and, above all, act and speak their lines with immediacy and truth. I understood every syllable. How often does that happen with U.S. actors? I must say, the words glowing with devotion to their craft sounds a bit off-color to me, coming from someone with questionable craft himself. The play was 1 hour 45 minutes, without intermissions, and I didn\u2019t feel the least bit weary or impatient. Nor did the people sitting around me, as we strangers gathered spontaneously to share our excitement and enjoyment. Score: 8.0 I saw this at the Vineyard and on Broadway, and remain entranced by it. It is both the story of the play and the story of the Jews in the 20th century. Neither story is just told, both are lived through the actors, who play many parts. It is the most moving piece of theater I have seen in a long time. Score: 2.0 Actually, the show was first staged at the Yale Rep (world premiere) before it was staged at the Vineyard theater. Score: 14.0 Indecent is an astonishingly beautiful and powerful play; it took my breath away. Not sure where to start in describing it. What it is to be a Jew in all its complexities, then and now? The Yiddish language? The love of two women in an historical moment? A blink in time one of the super titles, in English and Yiddish sums it up. My advice: Run, don't walk to see this production. You won't regret it. Score: 2.0 I saw this play last year when it was presented at The Vineyard Theater, and enjoyed it very much. Score: 12.0 Indecent was the finest play and production I have seen on Broadway in many years. It was a powerful, moving combination of so many theatrical elements that were seamlessly woven together. It was refreshing to see a play that presents noble and very human characters. I experienced this production as something unique and I treasured the experience. It was a moving dream. Score: 2.0 I applaud Ms. Vogel's work and attempt to convey this story. However, I thought it needed some serious editing; 1 hour, 45 minutes is too long for a show with no intermission. Score: 19.0 I found it deeply troubling in its parallels to our world today. It goes from 1905, when Jews were marginalized and ridiculed, to 1952, when 6 million of them were dead. I found myself identifying with 1905 -- that moment when they way First they come for others, then they come for you, to paraphrase. It was a cautionary tale telling us to be careful, to resist, and to support others who resist. The most depressing scene was when the rabbi of Temple Emmanuel in New York City ranted that the makers of the play should be thrown out of the country. Sound familiar. In the cast, Tom Nelis was a powerful presence throughout, and the young girls were fragile and funny. All the actors were skilled in more than one art -- dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments. The play could use a second, maybe a third look, to unearth all that is in it. Score: 10.0 If God of Vengeance was such a thrilling piece of theatre, why not put that on instead of building a frame around it? The answer was available up until just a few weeks ago when God of Vengeance, presented in the original Yiddish, was finishing up an off-Broadway run. My elderly father, who walks with a cane, climbed up many stairs with me to see what all the fuss was about. The 'fuss' was about twice as long as Indecent and with subtitles placed too high to both read them and watch the actors at the same time, an exercise in futility and frustration. Maybe they were right and the work should have been burned, not for being too scandalous, but for being clunky and chock full of exposition with every line of dialogue. It sounds like Ms. Vogel understood this and took the high road a la Shuffle Along, and gave us something now in the present that really wasn't much to begin with other than the trysty, twisty risque-ness of it's premise. Taken the way Mr. Brantley describes what is going on, it sounds like Indecent is the more worthwhile endeavor and thank God there's no time-travel to go back only to discover that the scandal itself is really all that was there. Vogel is a shrewd playwright who could tell how the approach was everything and more power to her for providing this high concept play and not resurrecting something that would have made us all go 'Huh?' Score: 9.0 The actual God of Vengeance is not clunky at all, at least not in the English translation I read years ago. I'm glad it is getting wider notice, but do share the misgiving as to why they didn't just do the original play (perhaps as an adaptation by the gifted Ms. Vogel) rather than an explication of it in a wholly separate work. I found this review oddly guarded. It's pretty clear Mr. Brantley didn't like it, but so much hoopla has been made of Vogel's Bway debut (overdue as the narrative consistently tells us), that he has to give her a soft landing. It reads as encouraging advice to a novice writer, rather than as a frank assessment of an established one. Score: 3.0 The Guthrie in Minneapolis is doing Indecent next season. Can't wait to see how their production will be different. Score: 23.0 No, Paula Vogel's play directed by Rebecca Taichman does not have a big reveal, since the reveal happens again and again and the lyricism of this reenactment shows an ongoing journey through history to bring this play to a time that can suit it. The scandal of indecency that it tells is the complexity of history that both moves forward even as it repeats itself. This is not a play looking for a dramatic formula. Also the Yiddish actor referred to who played the 1920s brothel owner was Rudolph Schildkraut, not Joseph his son. Joseph went on to play Lilliiom and many other roles on stage and screen including Otto Frank in The Diary of Anne Frank."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

He can learn all the French he wants but that will not be enough to get him elected, and there is a difference between being honest with people and demeaning them, of which Kevin cannot grasp. After you've watched a number of TV interviews with Kevin O'Leary it becomes very clear why he would be a poor fit for a high level political position. He's obviously an effective communicator, but his world-view and his intellect are narrowly focused, quite superficial and based on simplistic formulaic thinking; there just isn't the depth that's needed to deal effectively in the complex policy environments that characterize public service and the public sector.

When I grew up, in my particular social class, most children rarely saw their fathers. They were in uniform overseas serving Queen and country. It wasn\u2019t a big deal for us or for our fathers.

Score: 0 When I see this photo, I think of our world today and the society that we have created. Everything seems to be so loud, and everyone is speaking all of the time, yet no one seems to be listening. To me, this photo is showing us what we should do: close our eyes, shut our mouths, and listen. Not forever, but just for a moment. The first thing that had drawn me to this idea was the coloring of the photo. Everything is in black and white, and the headphones are red. This suggests that we often use our other parts-our eyes and mouths- in such colorful ways, but we forget to use our ears. In our society today, we embrace the 1st amendment, our freedom of speech- which is a great thing. A great thing until we begin to neglect others\u2019 ideas and look down upon people who think differently. By closing the passageways to the more colorful parts of ourselves today and opening up something that isn\u2019t always used, we can further develop our understandings of each other. I can connect to this photo because I find myself listening a lot. I enjoy listening to others\u2019 thoughts before forming opinions on my own. I have never been one to verbally involve myself in debates or opinionated discussions because I\u2019m fascinated with others\u2019 opinions. Sure, I debate with others in my head, but never aloud. I do believe that I should try to challenge myself and speak my mind, but I also appreciate my ability to take things in. Take a minute, close your eyes, your mouths, and open your ears. In an advancing society, technology grows all around us. We\u2019ve grown up immersed in television and inundated by the Apple industry, making technology a member of our families, carrying it around our pockets. This image elaborates on this idea, illustrating the way we use technology as a tool to drown out the world. We grow blind and deaf to our own surroundings, using our \u201cheadphones\u201d to ignore the alternative noise of the world, in turn making us mute to the world\u2019s issues. The image builds on the idea that technology has potential to be a detriment, creating a division between us and our world. I tend to do this, using the volume of my headphones to become ignorant of the problems of the real world. It remains a helpful defense from all the other noise; classmates and politics and parents, constantly disrupting our own little worlds with conflict and negativity. When I look at this picture, the thing I, and probably everyone else, notice first, are his senses. This is obvious and what he picture is on the outside, but it can have a deeper meaning when used to symbolize something that I can relate to my life. To me, the man is symbolizing a follower, blind with faith, and devoid of all logic. He doesn\u2019t use his senses and essentially cripples himself with his own closed minded thoughts. The reason I think of this is because, in my life, I see it everywhere: religion, government, even school. People follow others blindly, often walking right off a cliff because of their inability to make their own decisions, accept the inevitable flaws in whatever they are following, and overall lack of confidence to become the leader themselves. I think this image is expressing the hate in society. There is a man blindfolded with his mouth duct taped as well as red headphones. The only colorful part of the picture is the red headphones. The color red is a symbol for anger and hate. The fact that the man cannot see or talk but can only listen to what is on his headphones lends itself to the fact that he is listening to hatred. The image depicts that he is being brainwashed to be a hateful person. In the news lately there has been many instances of violence and white supremacy. I think the picture comments that there is a problem with society if most aspects of the news is violent in nature. My opinion on this image is that it is very accurate in our society. There is so much violence and hate in our society it almost feels as though it is being shoved down our throats. I see this picture and think about how we as a society are seemingly blind to all the evil happening in both our nation and the world as a whole. To me, this picture is saying a very large amount about the current political and the social climate of our nation. So many things come to mind such as trump and his inability to accept defeat, and the extremely large amount of men who\u2019ve been ousted over sexual harassment claims. I can even see this picture referring to the everyday working class American that turns a blind eye to the atrocities of America instead of working to help. The entire picture is black and white except for the headphones which are bright red. This shows me an obvious contrast between this man being unable to listen and our nation who have chosen a path of ignorance and to not listen. I would guess this picture is fueled by Trump\u2019s America and the various things he\u2019s done to shut down the rights of so many Americans. To many, it seems as if Trump himself cannot hear or see his wrongdoings. This picture can also be reflecting on how we as a people choose to ignore the corruption and sleaziness our government is thriving off of. I think that the image pertains to an old saying that I feel most people know which is \u2018see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\u2019. In today\u2019s day and age media and the people seem to be very limited to what they are exposed to can be very bias based on what the point of view is of what they\u2019re exposed to. It appears today, that the government can control all of what the public sees and what they hear and the people aren\u2019t able to speak out against the injustices because they can\u2019t. \u2018 See no evil\u2019 can also be an example of how the government turns a blind eye on things they feel are unappealing and would be better off if they were left ignored. The government can also prohibit what the public says about them and that can lead to people not being able to speak out against the actions of government officials therefore leading to the point of \u2018speak no evil\u2019. Finally those who represent the government and speak at press conferences talk about mostly the positive actions the government has taken in order to benefit the people but they never talk about the negative decisions that they make therefore the people can \u2018hear no evil\u2019 because they are being given the information through the head phones. All in all I think that the image represents the ways they keep on the good side of the American people but they also control the public in the sense of they control what the public knows and how they act with this knowledge. Welcome to America - home of the blind eye and the closed mouth, home of the perpetually open ears, perfectly coiffed hair, and pressed suits. Land of the tainted minds and unoriginal thoughts, where, somehow, everyone hears everything but says nothing. We absorb. We immerse. We are always taking in, even if we are not aware of it. The headphones are a double-sided metaphor. They are America\u2019s security blanket - we can choose what we hear, and we can make it agree with the little voice in our head, and that can be all that we hear if we want it to be. They are the buffer between the real world, where things aren\u2019t as perfect and poised as we\u2019d like them to be, where opinions aren\u2019t in perfect correlation with ours, where there are voices other than the one that we feed our minds with. Or, they are world itself. They are all we ever hear, they are all we ever absorb, they are all we have ever or will ever know, and we let them speak for us. The headphones become our voices, and soon they become louder than the inkling of conscience inside of us. I\u2019d like to say that I can\u2019t relate, that I refuse to let the roaring wildfire of the world overcome the spark in me, but I suppose in some ways, I can relate. I let the voice of everyone else, the roar of television and the scream of media overtake me, until sometimes, I find myself tainted and unoriginal. But, I suppose in many ways, every teenager, every adult, every American, feels that way at some point. Red headphones, and a muted man with a blindfold. If it were any other color, I would have thought this picture had a literal meaning, like how music quiets the soul. However, that is not the case. Especially in current events today, we are seeing many other people take a stand against the injustices of the world, and especially America, but we are also seeing a lot of people being forced to stay quiet. In recent news, Donald Trump is a sucker for firing or removing anyone from office if they disagree with his beliefs. In this picture, the man is wearing red headphones (the Republican color), with his mouth and eyes taped shut. Although this may be an allusion to Trump\u2019s ways of putting people in and out his cabinet, this also may just be the fact that many people are going along with what Trump is saying, but may not know how it is affecting people, because they are simply \u201cmuted\u201d and \u201cblinded\u201d from the world. Without seeing the consequences of your actions, your actions will indefinitely cause more harm than good. Thinking you know what is good for people, when in reality you can\u2019t see them or hear their calls for help, then what you think is not good for them at all. This picture may be pertaining to how the people interact with the world. As long as you don't hear, see, or say anything pertaining to the things going on around you, your world can remain as simple as black and white. People may not care around the things going on globally, or even locally, which causes them to become ignorant about current event. so that way they cannot actually formulate their own, unique opinions about things. I know I sometimes I get tired about hearing about all the bad things going on in the world, so I just tune it out for a while. Next thing I know, something new and eye opening comes up and I have no idea what's going on. It's a constant struggle to stay on top of things in this day and age. Although taking a break every from all the world's craziness is well and good, it's still good to know about the major and local stuff that is going on. This picture is emphasizing the fact that when bad things happen people pretend that they do not see or hear it going on. There could be many reasons that someone does not confess to what they saw; fear that something could happen to them or the person that they witnessed doing the attack could refrain them from speaking out. This could include witnessing someone being abused or killed and the witness fearing that the same thing may happen to them. There is also the fear that if you speak out, someone may not believe what you are telling them. Another reason is that they are trying to preserve their own image of what people think about them. Speaking out against something that everyone agrees with or follows could result in people looking down on you or not agreeing with what you are saying. Many people are only interested in themselves and what they could benefit from it. There are many things that people turn a blind eye to for their own reasons. This picture is emphasizing that it happens often but in my opinion people should always speak out for what they think is right even if it is against what others believe. The picture shows how people in our society are becoming unaware of what is around them. They are not aware because they use their headphones, and the blindfold shows they don\u2019t actually look at all of the things around them that actually mean something. His mouth is duct taped because he does not have an opinion on anything, and does not care about what happens around him. It is similar to the, \u201cHear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil,\u201d saying. It is because he is not aware of the things around him that he has no opinion on, but just because he isn\u2019t aware of the things, it doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t happening. The man, and everything around him is in black and white. This means the only thing he cares about is what his headphones are playing, and does not know what he is missing. I see this happening a lot wherever I go now a days. Most of the kids I see at my school have their headphones in, and do not care about what is around them. They just sit in class, don\u2019t contribute anything, and it seems as though that is all they are doing\u2026 sitting. To fix this, people should be open to trying to get away from just what they are hearing through headphones, and try to contribute something in class, or even at home if it means they will be more aware. Them being more aware can help them with their grades, their family, and sports. This picture could symbolize rumors among many other things. This picture have a negative vibe to it with the tape of the mouth that could remind others of kidnapping or consequences. People are so focused on what they that they don't pay attention to the source of the rumor, if it is true, or the reason behind it. This picture could also symbolize how if people just zone out and focus on the music they could find peace. They could center themselves through the music alone. This could be the consequences of only listening or the benefits of only listening. After analyzing the picture, my interpretation was influenced by the role of headphones in current day society. I perceived the picture as trying to inform the audience on how headphones are being utilized as a way for people to break away from reality and come off as \u201cblind\u201d (as shown by the covered eyes and the taped up mouth). In addition, since the headphones are on it further goes to show how because people hear various thoughts and opinions of others constantly (hence the headphones fully blocking both ears) they are left conflicted because they don\u2019t know what to say or believe. Conclusively, the picture in my opinion demonstrates that everyday people are hearing different things all the time, and because of that they\u2019re unsure of how to think or respond. On the other hand many may interpret the picture differently. Another perspective could be that the usage of headphones allows for someone to break away from society and have their own time to interpret and debrief from any pressures in life. Although the eyes and mouth are covered it could have the effect in showing that by making a time for silence or evening listening to music, it allows someone to have their own space to not see or say anything they would if they were angered / anxious. I believe this image is saying that in multiple different aspects of society today, people turn a \u201cblind eye\u201d to an issue, avoiding its presence. This image depicts a man with his ears, eyes, and mouth covered. From my observations, I believe that the image is relaying this message because this man is clearly avoiding something that he does not want to know if he has most of his senses unavailable. The message of this image can relate to the astounding \u201cme too\u201d campaign against sexual misconduct. Many people have been charged for purposely avoiding the issue and not addressing the problem, hoping that it would go away. The resurface of this campaign has changed the way people deal with this issue. No one can hid or avoid this issue any longer. Personally, a way I can relate to this image is if something is stressing me out, I will try to purposely avoid it until I absolutely have to address the problem. This is similar to procrastination, however the difference is I would pretend it\u2019s not there. In my opinion, this message is very powerful and I will certainly try to incorporate it into my life. Overall the message is encouraging people to not avoid their problems and face them head on. Music has transformed over time and it has transformed society as well. Music seems to follow the trends and emotions of society, and many people find comfort in that. There is nothing like putting on a pair of headphones, maximizing the volume, and just getting lost in a song. Music is not only suppose to be entertaining, but it can also be distracting as well. When people are plugged in listening to music with headphones on and the music blasting, they are very much unaware of what's going on around them. Although music can be distracting, it is distracting in a good way. Music tends to represent the feelings of society, and when people are lost in the music they, they tend to portray that message and emotion. Music brings people together and draws attention to current issues. For example, during the time around the Vietnam war, many groups including the Beatles transformed their style of music to a more rebellious style to express their anger for the Vietnam war. This can also be seen in society today with the #metoo movement. Many new artists have come out with new songs and or have made new versions of their songs expressing the strength of women. Female artists have come together to bring strength and power to all women, and help those find the voice that they have been looking for to stand up for themselves. For many people, all types and styles of music helps them to break their silence, not become silent like the image shows. Blindfolded and a duct taped mouth, this man is oblivious to the world around him. Some people may see that he is closed off to life outside the humming sounds of the red headphones. They could feel that the headphones are shutting him up and shutting him out. With blocked senses, he has lost his ability to express himself. However, though I can recognize this counterpoint, I believe that the headphones are actually opening him up to new experiences and new feelings he may never had gone through without them. Everything except the headphones in this image is in black and white revealing how monotonous and plain life can end up being without the pop of color. His cookie-cutter hairstyle and a clean-cut suit represent the boxes that society tends to put us in. As well, the blindfold and his mouth being taped shut adds to the ways life is restricting him from having a voice and truly seeing. With the headphones however, this man is being brought to life with varied colors, emotions and flourishing in a whole different world outside reality. In my personal experience, headphones, and further music, has become my escape from reality. Though my reality is oftentimes amazing (which I am grateful for), it can be difficult and hard to deal with. Listening to music enables me to reflect as well as enjoy solidarity. This piece of art represents a feeling to me; a feeling of being trapped but then being able to let go and experience color through a different lens (music). When first examining this image, I wanted to not think solely about the symbolism. I wanted to examine the facts about the picture itself. One may think at first glance that these are regular headphones, meaning he might be listening to something. I noticed quite quickly that these are noise cancellation headphones. This means he can\u2019t speak, see or hear. It can also be observed that he is dressed like a businessman, someone with power. After observing I then started to think about what it could be a symbol for. I believe the meaning behind this is that this man could represent the managers behind all the powerful men being accused of sexual misconduct as of late. The higher ups had to know something, yet they allowed their clients to walk free. This would mean they chose not to see anything, hear anything or say anything. Though that theory is very specific, I also feel that it could be more general. There are so many powerful people who see bad things happen and choose to keep quiet about it due to fear of losing their power. When I went to read the article, the first paragraph opened my eyes. I knew of the Presidents many twitter scandals and I often wondered why he wasn\u2019t banned from the social media. When initially thinking about the pictures meaning, this completely slipped my mind though makes so much sense. The use of the word \u201ccomplicit\u201d is perfect and is completely in line with my thoughts regarding the picture. Personally, I believe that the image is trying to convey the idea that with all of the new forms of media and all that is going on in politics right now, people are losing the ability to form their own opinions, the just listen to what other people say and do not think for themselves or craft an original idea. The fact that the man in the image only has headphones on and his mouth and eyes are covered suggests that all he does is passively listen to the ideas others try to force upon them and do not look at the situation themselves and try to speak their mind. I think that this rings true especially nowadays because with the news stations, political magazines and other forms of media trying to force their opinion into the minds of their audience, the audience members have begun to stop thinking about the situation themselves and just take in what other people have to say about the issue. This is very relevant because whenever people try to argue about a topic especially in politics it just seems like everybody is regurgitating the same point made by some news anchor or political analysts and nobody has their own personal view on the situation. I think that it is very important that people begin to think for themselves again because without the ability to create an idea for themselves society is going to drift into a mind numbing state were nobody is even able to think for themself any more and there will be no variety in peoples opinions. The image in the prompt shows a person who is blindfolded and duck taped on mouth, that could symbolize many things but I personaly thought it represents something like rumors that are shared because you hear a rumor, but you haven't seen what the rumor is or even discuss with the person to who the rumor relates to. As I examine the picture the picture more I seem to realize that the person was wearing a headphone not only that but it was red while the other part of the picture was black and white , red could represent our country's government because it is republican which is red. So, I thought that the picture here relates to our current government and the steps that they are taking. The image could represent that the people who fail to recognize the perspective of the government or are not able to talk about it. My first thought was how many teenagers and kids use headphones constantly and are cut off from society. They don\u2019t have a voice in today's politics or opinions. I disagree with this completely. I love to listen to headphones to calm myself down or jam out in the car. I think I notice more and I am more attentive with headphones, especially in the car while listening to music. It\u2019s great to notice where I am and what\u2019s going on outside. I think that the tape over the eyes and mouth are symbols for how teenagers don\u2019t have a big of an impact on society as adults do. Unfortunately, I believe that this is true. There aren\u2019t many platforms or places for teens to discuss situations or problems in the real world with adults or politicians. Adults either won\u2019t listen or think their own ideas or better. You could argue that there are social media platforms that teens can access. Many adults and politicians aren\u2019t able to see the comments that are made by teens because teens don\u2019t have many followers or social media sites don\u2019t show their comments. I think there should be a better way for teens to put their voice out into the world and not be blindfolded by adults. This is one reason I enjoy commenting in the New York Times because I know that adults and teens alike are able to access my comments. The first thing that I thought of when I saw this image was that sometimes we are forced to take orders or listen to something that we aren\u2019t allowed to speak up about. We are sometimes forced to receive information and there\u2019s nothing that we can do about it. We hear these things and we can\u2019t see them for what they truly are, and we can\u2019t voice our opinions on them. I find that this relates to changes that are being made today in the world politically. The people of our nation most of the time are forced to sit and listen to what our president wants to happen. We can try and reach out discussing our complaints but sometimes they go unnoticed. We are forced to sit and listen to the new laws of our land, without being able to say anything to stop it and without being able to see the long term effects. thus passage is about head phones but not really. it is about the photo and yes i do relate to is"", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Perhaps it was a masterpiece, and should be revisited one of these days. Then there was 'Swept Away', which was quite brilliant, energetic and ironic, except I started sliding down my seat because my elegant parent was with me and the language was spicy and strong enough to trot a mouse on. Fifty Shades of Grey filled me with envy. Envy of the author who was able to carry it off successfully, entertaining to read the comments, while feeling that it might be rather bland, lacking an edge to it for my young taste at a mature age. ' All to say, for those who enjoyed 'Grey', Darker sounds promising. A fun outing, nothing too sinister to upset romantics, and just stay away from movies like 'The Comfort of Strangers'.

At that time I was in my early 70's, sexually and physically active. After reading less than a quarter of a hard copy, I become bored of Dakota, who projected a predictable and simple naivete. The further I read, the more bored I became. I put the book down six years ago. It will languish for a long time in spite of my oddity of completing books once begun. Perhaps, I will download the movie. Does that fulfill the requirement of completing the novel?

About 1/4 of the way into the film we started giggling and about the 1/2-way mark we were roaring with laughter and creating our own MST3000.

We need an army of therapists to help people. Once the Republicons are out of power we should implement this as part of Medicare for All. This is really beautiful - those who choose to share give a really positive message and image. Score: 7 The word Anonymous in Alcoholics Anonymous encapsulates a sacred and profoundly practical concept. In order for the fellowship to grow and prosper, the early members, after some embarrassing episodes, realized that there could not be a spokesperson for AA. No one would appear as members of AA in press, radio or television in order to protect the organization from the spokesperson who relapses or otherwise digresses and ensured the frightened newcomer that their attendence would be protected. As AA has grown, there are now those who join because they stand a chance to further their own celebrity, or at least sit next to one. So we would all be Anonymous. The 12th Tradition is still a central to AA's continued survival. Are there people who violate the tradition? Does that make it acceptable? Only 1 person in this essay actually broke her anonymity, and several took care to not show their faces, and they are to be commended for respecting the organization that saved their lives. Ms. De Alba must be a persuasive person to have found funding for this barely disguised vanity project. She persuaded Ms. Bailey after 3 years of asking this beautiful woman. I posit Ms. De Alba is exploiting her experience in recovery at the expense of AA's traditions, and not just the 12th. I will always remember how the deceased columnist, Dear Abby, wrote about AA. To those who had a drinking problem, she suggested: Go to a meeting. Score: 6 Anonymity in the program is a choice, and the 12th tradition states that breaking one's own anonymity is acceptable as long as the motivation isn't vanity and it helps to bolster the program. If I choose to not remain anonymous, it's not a slight against AA--and while I can't speak to the photographer's motives for doing this project, I commend the effort to show women in long term recovery leading fulfilling, incredible lives because of AA. There is a tremendous misconception about recovery and lifelong sobriety in the mainstream media, and too much misinformation and misrepresentation. The women who agreed to be photographed should be seen, in my opinion, as the exact opposite of a celebrity spokesperson who has no vested interest in getting sober apart from PR. The existence of this project is a positive one. Score: 3 I'm sorry you feel this way. For the record, the only reason Ms. Bailey rescheduled our sessions was because of her busy schedule. Now at 92, she is in the care of her daughter and her active life slowed down enough to welcome me. Our goal is to help and celebrate long term recover. Not all women are in twelve step programs. Score: 0 I met some guys in AA many years ago. They had AA tattoos. Were gung ho about their sobriety, their newfound enlightenment. I imagine they were found dead drunk somewhere, probably some scars running through those tats. Anonymity does not mean secret; it means protection for oneself; it means respect for others privacy. Respect. AA is no secret society with the aim of sobering the individual up to become arrogant, sanctimonious, or zealous in condemnation of views or actions. For that there is politics, religion, and parenthood. It is about realization. It is about respect, for self, for others. It is about living. Whether one outs oneself is up to the individual. But if one hides that past, that old self, one should make quite sure there is good reason to hide it, because it is simply shame, there is some work to do. It is a wonderful topic for discussion.

Score: 0 Maybe women with ADHD crave large amounts of licorice with glycyrrhizin, and the cognitive defects or ADHD are inherited. Someone needs to look to see if the women who consume a lot of licorice are different from the control group. People with ADHD have been known to seek out ways to self-medicate. I live in Italy where you can buy concentrated pure liquorice drops. There is a caution on the box that people with high blood pressure should not overconsume them. I have low blood pressure but that is enough to remind me of the active ingredients, so I try not to overdo it. Otherwise I think I would suck on them all day long, as they clearly give you a slight pick-me-up. So I am not suprised to discover that liquorice releases cortisone. I had read somewhere that liquorice helps regulate levels of cortisone and can be helpful in small doses in controlling autoimmune disorders. So I think this news about it being potentially harmful to unborn babies is very important. Also because AFAIK most women in Italy who buy these drops are either trying to lose weight or stop smoking. I have discovered that just one pure liquorice drop can calm a cough and clear the airways. In fact it's an ingredient in cigarettes, to assist smokers in maintaining their deadly habit. By the way, I also discovered quite by chance that one or two fennel bulbs, consumed before or during a transatlantic flight, helps greatly with jetlag. Fennel is not related to liquorice but has very similar active ingredients. Am I replacing the right combination of minerals, giving my gut some help, or maybe even raising cortisone levels for the duration of flight? That study must be flawed.

Licorice consumption is much higher in Scandinavia than in the US. When I read the headline, my first thought was I bet this study was conducted in Denmark. So, yes, people really do consume this amount of real licorice. Score: 6 Drinking licorice tea gave me hypertension. Just because it is natural does not mean it is safe. Please Google hypertension from licorice for more information.

Score: 4 I have used Deglycyrrhizinated licorice root extract for treatment of gastric reflux. Obviously that means that the glycyrrhizin is removed because of it's potential side effects. Licorice tea is a natural galactagogue, which stimulates the production of breast milk and is recommended to help in nursing. I wonder if the glycyrrhizin can be passed to the infant that way? Would deglycyrrhizinated licorice be a safer galactagogue? Seriously, what are they going to advise against next? I feel like they're just looking for things now. Also, who eats that much licorice? I guess it's good that licorice fiends know this, but most of the abundant don't do this during pregnancy research  reads to me less as a reason for total exclusion of whatever they're studying and more as support for moderation. Honestly, the research about what's bad in pregnancy has just become tiring at this point. Considering that licorice isn't exactly health food, it would have been helpful to compare the BMIs or SESs of the maternal groups. Score: 2 some people never miss an opportunity to fat shame.

Could it be that women eating this much licorice are consuming more junk food and processed foods than other women? Could it be that their diets taken on whole are poor?

Students will improve their critical thinking skills and, as a result, become more informed and productive citizens by reading trustworthy content. I started reading the New York Times, as a mandatory part of Professor & Colonel John Kane's history class, at New York Military Academy. It was in '61 ( I graduated in '63). I never stopped reading it on a daily basis - now mostly digitally. The integrity of the free press, and the preciseness of journalistic writing has never been lost on me because of that early exposure. If the school sounds familiar, schoolmates of mine included Robert Benmosche, '62, who arguably saved this country, if not the world, from financial collapse, and Donald Trump, '64 - his full impact yet to be determined. Early in my advertising career, at Della Femina, Travisano & Partners, I was fortunate to work on the advertising campaign for The New York Daily News where the campaign featured the famous writers, Truman Capote, Ayn Rand, and George Plimpton to name a few, who wrote ads for, and in commercials spoke about clarity in writing and editorial opinion. Newspapers and journalism are a vital part of what makes a country and its people both knowledgeable and contributors to the common good. I have never forgotten the early lessons learned, although I feel they may have been lost on the classmate who became our 45th president. The New York Times was a significant part of my education and that of my fellow cadets. I know its importance in helping educate students today. The Support Our Mission Program couldn't be more necessary than it is right now. How can we contribute to expansion into more schools? I learned from this article that the modern-day internet was already being discussed in 1967. I was a child at that time and don't recall if I'd even heard of computers. If only we'd had this kind of program then! - or a similar one in Canada. The need is stronger these days than ever. I started reading the NY Times in probably 8th grade, along with The Herald Tribune. We got both papers delivered to Great Neck South Senior High School-this must have been in 1961 or 1962. I became addicted to the crossword puzzles in both papers, and am still addicted. The Support Our Mission program is a terrific idea, especially * now* when it's m ore important than ever to read real news. We received The NY Times every day when I was an 8th grade student at Immaculate Heart of Mary School in Scarsdale,NY. That was 1976! lead story in the right-most column, etc. I started reading the NY Times in 1954 at age 7. I had to lay it on the floor because I didn't have the wingspan to hold it open. Every morning, before school, weather permitting, I would walk the 1 block to our local candy store and buy ( for 5 CENTS! ) the Times. When I arrived at PS173 there were copies of The Herald Tribune waiting for those of us who had paid for it. I also read the Post and the LI Press every day. My favorite section was the Sports section. In 1957 I added the Wall Street Journal to my daily newspaper reading list. Today I read the Times on line but read the WSJ and Cleveland Plain Dealer in print form. The Support of Our Mission school sub program is a really good idea. Count me as one of the folks who read School Weekly in the late 1960s, and was introduced to The Times by an elementary school teacher after seeing only the Daily News at home. I'm grateful to her, and to you. I know people who think the New York Times is elitist, some think the writing is boring. I was one of the fortunate ones whose undergrad professor required that his class, our class, was required to get a subscription. We had to write about and discuss articles directly taken from the Times. It was so many years ago, and I have long ago forgotten the Media professor's name. But, I will always be grateful to him. Grateful, even for being compelled to carry the big, clumsy Times around every Sunday, back in the day. I hope there will be a way for teachers to require the same of their students, with reduced subscription rates for young students, or some arrangement for free access online to kids. Our children need to have access to the best journalism on or offline. And as we all know, when it comes to newspaper and online journalism, The New York Times is the finest. I hope we can find a way to make it a standard for our children at all grade levels, and debunk the myth that the Times is elitist or difficult or boring.

The similarities to Shutter Island was a little too marked for my taste. I kept thinking I was watching Leo di Caprio with weird contacts. I was also puzzled because I sat the whole way waiting for the appearance of one of my favourite actors. Oscar Isaac, only to realise he wasn't in it Hate it when that happens... other than that it was pleasantly whacko outing but really a tad overlong. I believe you completely missed the point. This is a movie about ego destruction, just like Fight Club and The Matrix. I was totally engrossed in this movie. One of my best for the year so far. This movie is almost a straight book-to-movie translation of The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann, arguably my favorite book -- with a few horror elements thrown in. Score: 3 Eels. After watching the Tin Drum eons ago, I will never ever ever ever ever ever watch another movie featuring eels. I agree with Mr. Scott's list of films and filmmakers that influenced A Cure For Wellness. But he forgot one: 60's-era Roger Corman. The whole climax, with its burning mansion and gory makeup effects, were right out of any three or four of Mr. Corman's gaudy, entertaining Poe adaptations. Score: 1 Watch Sam Fuller's Shock Corridor instead of this. It's a good little B movie that beats this film by a mile. Mr. Scott omits the only significant thing about this movie: its repulsive, inflammatory fake news marketing campaign which has a few of us calling for a boycott of all Fox media. Oh well, it's only journalism in the Newspaper of Record. Score: 2 Eels were often put into hand dug wells to eat the algae that grew and generally keep the water source clean. That is probably how they got into the aquifer (as much as the set-up needs a rationale). They are strong and have an amazing ability to survive, transversing long distances to find a hospitable place. Remember when movies like The Blair Witch project set up a website to convince people that it might be based on real events? We all thought that was great marketing, didn't we? Even though it was fake. Trickery is nothing new for media marketing. Sometimes it's considered a clever slight of hand, sometimes it's considered completely out of line. The very beginning of the movie is impressive. It holds promise. There is a driving logic of a greedy corporation about to come apart at the seams with a missing corporate executive hold up in a health spa in eye popping Switzerland., who requires retrieving. The bizarre cinematography never flags, so it holds fascination, but the plot seems to go into a dozen different directions. At the end it is purely lurid and comical. Nice catch with the reference to the atmosphere in Shutter Island DeHaan makes a fine cut rate Di Caprio. BTW how is one force fed dozens of live eels and then comes out entirely normal after the experience? Score: 1 I point out to Mr Scott that Shutter Island is itself a parody of a classic silent film?

I absolutely refuse to reward Fox for such loathsome tactics. Score: 3 As much as I admire Mr. Scott's takes on cinema, including this one, they do nevertheless reveal that serious cinema and serious film criticism are both highly specialized forms, perpetuating the old high art, low art argument. It's probably my old Midwest background that this grates on me. Perhaps those outside the Midwest might see the Midwestern take on things as a kind of schmaltzy common sense? Then again, common sense seems to be in short supply these days--certainly in the world(s) of cinema. Score: 16 Isn't this the movie by Fox touted with a slew of fake news stories?

And a verified commenter, doesn't have to wait for moderation. As for the seemingly personal grudge, I believe Mr. Scott did him a heinous wrong long ago, like talked him into going to see Ishtar, and Mr. Freeman has never forgiven him, although I might have made that rumor up just now. Score: 11 but I actually do see most of the movies that are reviewed here, albeit not as quickly as film critics- who catch them at pre-opening press screenings- do. As I see well more than two movies per week (more like 300 per year) it may well be the case that I see more of them than Mr. Scott does. As for my comments being published, why should that be important to someone who uses a pseudonym to conceal his/her own identity? Score: 6 Interesting sounding film, and I liked the review considerably. In return I'd like to answer a couple of Mr. Scott's questions. The eels are not scavengers, so they can't be eating simple human waste products, excess skin and hair, that kind of thing. Undoubtedly the ecosystem is that the septic waste is fuel for algae, the algae became home to small crustaceans, and the eels primarily eat the crustaceans. They might also dine on bits of living human now and then, everything that moves is prey for an eel. Also it is quite OK to use the term red herring as it is of American origin. Red herring were salted fish that early European colonists would carry and drop on their trail as they went, hunting and trapping, for an excellent reason: it would throw the wolves that were tracking them off their scent. Also if their hunting didn't go well, in emergencies, they could eat the herring. Anyway seems like this is a well-done film where primarily the fun would be trying to spot all the references to better films. Score: 14 Considering that A.O. Scott no longer bothers to review any movie he plainly dislikes ( we're left to conclude that what we've got here is a pretty bad weekend for new theatrical releases. Fist Fight and Cure for Wellness- are of the  but I liked it anyway variety, meaning that anyone who has to plunk down $15 or so to purchase an admission ticket is going to walk out feeling like the victim of an unarmed robbery. Insofar as Wellness is concerned, Mr. Scott cites a number of second-hand allusions to third-rate movies by Paolo Sorrentino and Guillermo del Toro as well as to one of the few outright disasters in the canon of Martin Scorsese. Which is supposed to represent a recommendation, I guess. When you forage in a trash heap what do you generally end up with? Score: 2 I do focus on the writing which is polished, well-organized, utterly readable and expressive of the same critical standards and disciplines that one could glean from the ratings for new releases posted on Cinemascore. From America's paper of record I don't believe it's wrong to expect something tougher and altogether more incisive. Score: 3 Fewer words would suffice to convey your message. Score: 0 Apparently Mr. Freeman wants to see more take-down style reviews from A.O. Scott. I would bet like most NYT readers, I seek out Scott's reviews to find recommendations of films I'm likely to enjoy. I have no trouble determining what I don't want to see. But what's out there I want to invest my movie-going time wisely, and I've found that my taste coincides with Scott's.

If so, what should they be? Score: 0 I read the first few sentences and its already very true. Boys play offense and the girls play defense. An analysis of nearly 500 accounts from 12-to 18-year-old girls about their negative experiences with sexting found that over two-thirds had been asked for explicit images. That\u2019s so sad to think about, and what is even worse is that the majority sends explicit photos out of intense pressure with intent of affection or discretion. However, this leads to threats, harassment and even more requests for explicit photos. Researcher have found that boys four times likely to pressure girls to send sexts. Most school as well as parents tell their kids/students to not send a sext, but we don\u2019t ask them to stop asking for sexts. Consequences are not something that minors don\u2019t regard with full attention, they don\u2019t understand the potential personal, and possibly legal consequences of creating and distributing sexually explicit content. Teenagers don\u2019t think this is a bad idea, they think its cool to get nudes from their current girlfriend or boyfriend. That\u2019s why it accrues so much, its like a forever going trend. 1- Nudes are such a common occurrence in high school nowadays, many teenagers are completely numb to it. Every single one of my female friends has been asked for nudes, but I have never heard of a girl asking a guy. However, equally as abusive, almost all of my friends have been sent unsolicited explicit photos from boys, some they didn't even know. Everyone in my middle school was advised of the legal consequences of nudes, yet this continues to be a common occurrence. This article accurately captures the pressure on young girls to send explicit pictures, and this problem extends way beyond this one issue. Today as a teenager sexting feels like a normal thing. Although I don't do it a lot of my friends seem to do it, boys and girls alike. No one really thinks about it anymore as sexting but just as normal talking/dating or something that just happens. No one really knows why or at least I don't think so. I think parent are scared to talk about sex with their children so its left to the child to find out themselves. Teenagers are curious and will find out any means necessary. This article did make me mad though. It creates this feeling that girls never want to sext but guys force them into it. Thats just not true. As a teenage boy I experience this first hand. Girls text me and they ask me if I want to sext. Another thing the article talks about is girls being forced to sext. This is also primarily not true. Sexting is different than sex in the way that you are not with the person. You can easily block a person or just say no when you're sexting, which is a very common thing for girls to do. All and all sexting is a cultural problem that will probably never stop. As a young adult in highschool, I hear about these problems all the time, girls putting themselves out there and trusting boys and their sincerity, only to be blackmailed and embarrassed when these men break their promises. Next thing you know that one picture accidentally gets sent out to the rest of the grade or on social media, and their reputation is ruined. My advice if I were a parent: Don't flip out. Don't judge or shame your kid for the mistakes they've made, they've already accepted their punishment at school, and the last thing they need is to feel alone at home too. You can't change the past so why dwell on it, rather explain and sit down with them and treat them like adults, teenagers are not stupid and don't deserve to be treated so. The more you yell and get angry the less they will want to come to you about things like this, only making things worse in the future. We were born into technology and nothing can change that, so sexting and taking nude photos will always be a norm. Social media is a huge responsibility and what's on the internet can never be removed, so warn your kids instead of belittling them for what they can't control, the fact that for us technology will always be a part of our lives. People should let there children know that sex is not something to be taken lightly and don't send pictures that could ruin your life. This is ridiculous. These are children. There\u2019s no need to be flexible in these matters. Don't send anything you wouldn't put on your facebook home page. It will end up on redit in short order. Even if the person is trustworthy, lost or hacked phones account for sizable collection, you too can be on TMZ. In today's society sexting is very common especially with advanced technology. Many trusted adults in my community lead teens to believing that sexting is not the way in a relationship. Nobody can be trusted online because you never know who you are actually talking to. Pictures can be spread everywhere around the world, and you never know if they will come back to haunt you. Sending an inappropriate picture is equivalent to getting a tattoo because it will always be with you. Informing teens about sexting is very important because this is a life lasting decision. The article illustrated the problem of teenage sexuality and sexting very clearly, I think. I've heard numerous stories about girls who were pressured by boys they may not even know to take and send nude photos, and how they were spread to others or used as blackmail. This is a truly illuminating example of how girls get the short end of the stick in situations such as these, because while a lot of advice given about sexting consists of warning girls not to take or send sexual photos, people don't think to look for the common cause of the problem: harassment. Such harassment is perpetrated because of the sexual power and status that men represent in our society, and is the root that stems to America's rape culture.  Girls are advised to not wear revealing clothing, never walk alone at night, to not get drunk, but rarely is it ever said: Try to not sexually harass anyone, please.  Excuses such as boys will be boys and men can't control their libido fuels and justifies much of the sexual harassment that some boys feel entitled to do. The author says, we accept and perpetuate the boys-play-offense and girls-play-defense framework because it is so atmospheric as to be totally invisible, and that we should focus on the asking for nudes more so than the sending, and I completely agree. We occupy ourselves so much with trying to defend ourselves that we're ignoring the underlying problem at hand: our tolerance for the abuse of sexualised power, as the author states. The advice given to children is not much effective when attempting to resolve the problem of sexting. From school, we have learn that sexting, if caught, can grow into a huge situation that can greatly affect your future, and how others see you. Being a teenager in high school, I hear a great deal about this person sent pictures to this person, this person asked this person for nudes, and so on. In fact, some of my friend have received one. Parents, teachers, and adults should really spread the word about how to say no, how this one action can ruin your future, real penalties people faced when caught, and so on. Adults should really spread the word that these are real things to be cautious of. Advice for teenagers who are dealing with sexting-related issues are to get away and stop. Get away from the subject, the person, and the whole thing in general. Make sure people know that you do not do stuff like that, and will never. Score: 1 In my experience, most nude photos that have been sent to anyone most likely end up getting spread, one way or the other. My advice is don't sext, period. I've seen such an incredible amount of drama started which can all trace back to the sending of nudes or any from of sexting. If you don't sext, you don't get into those types of situations, simple as that. Score: 0 Unfortunately, I believe this phenomenon is much more pervasive and toxic than most parents care to believe, though this problem is not just exclusive to teenagers, but to preteens and young adults as well. Nude photographs and explicit text are uniquely private and intimate and are unbelievably easy to exploit, even by those we believe we can trust. This is not only a scenario in which someone\u2019s private photographs can be used as blackmail, but a scenario in which unwanted nude pictures or explicit content are sent without consent to exert power, to harass, or just out of lack of common sense. The most parents can do is to advise their children to cut ties with the people in their lives that ask for or send nude pictures, and warn about the legal and psychological consequences of relationships with such partners. I completely agree that the parents of our generation have failed to realize the severity of the \u201cnudes\u201d issue among teenagers, and would even go as far to say that they misunderstand the situation completely. As you put it, the scenarios are toxic. They are almost always one sided, ignore true emotion, and they frequently involve coercion. This includes, as noticed from the studies, \u201cpersistent requests, anger displays, harassment and threats\u201d. However, I also agree that parents cannot simply tell their children not to send nude photographs, which \u201cignores the complicated tensions they are negotiating on a regular basis\u201d. So I believe that you are correct saying that the most parents can do is advise to cut ties and warn of harmful consequences. Yet I find this sad. If both parents and children really want a change, it won\u2019t come from their individual actions, but much needed societal reform. To end practices like the toxic exchange of \u201cnudes\u201d, we need to work towards representative and equal norms in society. Score: 1 Such an important and complicated issue. At KQED (a PBS and NPR member station in San Francisco) we produced a video that looks at the legal consequences for minors who engage in sexting. Sexting among teens is, unfortunately, pretty common. Sharing inappropriate pictures is problematic enough, but it becomes even more of a problem when the pictures are shared abroad. Information and pictures can be easily spread through social media, e-mail and test messaging. I believe parents need to educate their kids about the consequences of sexting. It is a dangerous thing that everyone needs to be educated about. Score: 0 If someone, any age, is pressuring you, it's call Sexual harassment Score: 1 and that if you are under 18 and send or share an explicit pictures you are committing FELONY. Child porn laws apply to this conduct, so it certainly demands some form of significant punishment. Even though harsh, It calls for some intense discussions about judgement and decision-making. Not fair, maybe. but it will scare the heck out of your teen. Education The more kids know about this law in your area, the better they will act. Score: 0 I feel as though Adults should in a respectful and reassuring way state the consequences of sexting. When adolescents feel attacked I believe that that is the moment that kids act out and do as they please without thinking of how it may affect the future. However, I also believe that setting rules for asking and sending pictures would be ineffective because regardless of the amounts of rules given to kids, they will do what they want. That is why the advice about consequences would suffice because it'll let kids know kids the dangers without them thinking that every aspect of their life is being controlled. Score: 1 I have been in a few situations of being asked to send nudes and I do not feel this has much affect on my life. I tend to ignore things like that because I know it's some dumb teenage boy that does not know better. I have witnessed a friend being harassed by regrettable pictures that she sent to a boy. The boy showed the pictures to his friend and he harassed her to send more pictures. The boy first pressured her into doing something that she didn't want to do and violated her privacy by sharing them. I remember her mother finding out and being very harsh with her punishment. Boys not just harass girls for pictures, but harass with pictures. I have been send nudes from guys with no warning or even word. When I was about 13 years old, my mother talked to me about the consequences of sending nudes. I was very surprised to hear of the legal consequences like being listed as a sex offender. I thought that it was a choice made by the girl to send them to the guy who asks for them and that should not be a legal matter. Now I see how big of a deal it can be and that it is important to have consequences. Score: 0 I believe this article very accurately depicts the rising sexting culture the vast majority of teens habituate. Especially as technology becomes more and more accessible, seemingly everyone is surrounded and infatuated with the endless possibilities of communication achievable through their screens. So much in fact, that most people have developed a distorted sense of how personal and trusting they should be with others via their devices. I know numerous teens who have had their explicit photos secretly saved by the person they sent them to, and then sent around completely out of their control. Furthermore, I know of others who have had the photos saved to their family's iCloud, leading to unfathomably awkward conversations with their families. even jail time in some cases. Moreover, I find it concerning that the statistics proving males' higher likelihood of pressuring girls for photos of this nature is so distinct. In light of all that is going on regarding sexual misconduct, in particular the Me Too movement, it makes me think that -- although it could not be entirely eliminated -- the awareness of this issue could prevent this sexting issue, which is the norm in today's world, from expanding into sexual harassment and assault such as molestation and rape. Both the Me Too movement and sexting stories provided in the article draw uncanny parallels which must be addressed and cured. Score: 1 Personally, I have heard many horror stories concerning sending nudes and sexting in general. Many teenagers think that Snapchat, which is a popular social media app that allows users to send timed photos that disappear after the designated amount of seconds, is a safe and valid place to share nude photos. It makes sense, if this app didn't already exist and I was told the basic premise, it would sound like it was practically made for sending and receiving sexually explicit photos. In fact, Snapchat has even implemented a feature known as My Eyes Only, where the user can store private photos and videos in a certain section in which they can only view them after entering a password. Even though this may seem like a safe space to save, store, and share nudes, it is quite the opposite. Once you send a picture, anything can be done with it. I was aware that possession of sexually explicit photos of minors is considered child pornography in many states, but I did not know that someone could become a registered sex offender just by being in possession of the photos. This was surprising and somewhat frightening to me, considering that many of my peers engage in this activity. I believe that this is an issue that is not talked about enough, especially in schools. Teenagers need to see the severity of this situation and should think twice to themselves before sending or requesting this content. Score: 0 My friends and I, unfortunately, been all asked for sexual pictures. The experiences in the article were, to some extent, more extreme than what I, personally, have experienced. The harassment or pressuring with no where to turn however is something I have experienced. This is what we consider \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cexpected\u201d when dealing with boys our age which, when taken into consideration, is a fail for our society. I am well aware of the social and legal consequences in regards to sexting or sending sexual photos. Although I have never been taught these consequences by a parent or teacher, media has showed me the extent of the punishment an adult could recieve when he or she is sexually involved with a minor. In society, girls are usually taught to cover themselves up or be able to defend themselves [against boys] rather than boys being taught to respect girls no matter the age. These different messages can conjure up the wrong ideas for both parties. I think parents and teachers, or adults in general should try to normalize sexting or at least acknowledge the expression sexuality in a positive, respectful light rather than leave it to the teenager to figure out for themselves. If sexuality was normalized, teens would be able to find outlets to express their sexting-related issues and ask for help. Personally, I have been asked for nude photos before but have never sent any. It is not a good feeling because you feel as though the person you thought cared about you for you only cares about your body. As for the social and legal consequences to asking and sending naked images, I was not aware. I was mostly shocked by the fact that it is possible to be registered as a sex offender. The sexual dynamics do seem true to me just because I know of so many girls that have been asked for photos, have sent photos, and even boys who have asked for them. About the different messages from society, I'm not sure what my opinion on that is. Advice that adults could give students is to not send nudes, but, if they decide to send those pictures to just be careful of who they send said photos to because you never know how the person could use the pictures. Once they're sent, there's no getting them back. I don't know how I feel about rules because based on my experience as a teenager as well as experiences of friends, rules tend to be broken since teens can be rebellious. Setting rules or not would be up to the adult in charge but, both boys and girls should be informed on why asking or sending nude photos is not a good idea and of the bad consequences that can come from it. I think the most helpful support for teens going through this is informing students and bettering education on sexual harassment. Maybe teens will make better choices if they knew the consequences. It is not out of the ordinary for me to hear, or see someone being pressured to send a sext. Although I have had this experience myself, the pressure was never as severe as those stated in the article. Luckily, my friends have not experienced any cases of sexting, threats, or harassment to that extent either. However, it's evident that no matter the severity, sexting is an issue that the majority of teenagers face. The legal consequences are matters I did not know about before reading this article, but I was very aware of the social risks that sexting can cause. I was surprised that if caught sexting, the person could be registered as a sex offender. I imagined previously that they would receive a sort of fine, or a report considering the amount of people who sext and receive little to no consequence. It is very evident to me that boys tend to pressure girls into sexting more than girls pressure boys. Despite this, I believe that boys are easily pressured into asking or demanding for sexts by their friends who might have done it previously, or are in the midst of the action. When it comes to sexting, the talk teachers, counselors, and parents should give can get a little awkward, but is very important. It is urgent that as role models, these adults should educate teens on the risks and dangers of sexting. Rules should be set in place in order to keep both boys and girls safe from these social and legal consequences. I think teens need a safe place to talk and get informed. In my own experiences, I have not been pressured to send sexts. I know my case is not necessarily the norm, and I'm lucky to say that. I've definitely known and known of girls who have been pressured to send nude phtotos, even if they didn't want to. I found that in Rhode Island, an individual can spend up to 15 years in prison, and would be registered as a sex offender, if they possessed nude photos of a minor, even if they were a minor. I'm more aware of the social ostracization that comes along with sending nudes. For women especially, sending nudes tends to result in the same sort of victim shaming that accompanies sexual assault. Basically, the sender is at fault in these interactions, for sending pictures to a person of questionable intentions. What this response fails to ignore is the unhealthy power structure between men and women. This is even more so evidence of men's sexuality being celebrated and excused, whereas women are encouraged to virtuous and pure, which leads to their sexuality being repressed. I think the best thing we can do as a society is to stop chastising women for being taken advantage of by men. I know this is easier said than done, but I think education can definitely be a weapon against sexual discrimination. Maybe this means altering our already lacking sexual education courses; I'm not entirely sure. Still, I'm hopeful for my generation, as we are increasingly more comfortable to acknowledge the faults with our society and try to repair them.

The news articles and videos I saw during research showed me that it effects everyone in some way, and has caused many deaths in the U.S. Teenage sexting, and sexting of any matter is horrible. My goodness do I feel old now. As time has progressed, children have lost the idea of morals and basic decency. Boys become less chivalrous and treat girls they like poorly, and the issue is girls get so high off of being with a bad boy. Parents, teachers, counselors, even older siblings need to explain how big of an issue sexting is and what happens on the internet will always stay there. The best way to help with this is to take the battle to the source, so bring them together with their significant other and make sure they understand how a healthy and consensual relationship is healthier than pure lust and abuse. Score: 3 I have had guys and girls alike ask me for nudes, mainly guys. As a female with what is considered a nice body, this is a daily occurrence. In my life, it's been hard for me to tell who is actually interested in me as a person and who just wants to see me naked. I myself know better than to give in because those pictures spread like a wildfire, and those idiots don't deserve that. However, teenagers are hormonal and naive. Other girls and even gay guys I know have been promised love and affection and a relationship in exchange for those pictures. And when they sent them, they either get exposed and slut-shamed or blackmailed into sending more. Not to mention the consequence of not sending is being cussed out or worse. It's a serious problem at our age. I think parents should warn their children of this, of the liars out there; instead of just saying it's morally wrong. I think parents and adults, in general, should be more helpful to teenagers who go through this kind of thing; and if a guy or girl is guilty of pressuring another person into this, they should be more harshly punished than a slap on the wrist. Score: 2 In today's society, sexting seems so much more natural because of the access young kids have to the internet. With all of this accessibility, kids need to be educated about how to say no to being pressured into sending those kinds of pictures, but much of the time they don't listen to a teacher standing at the front of an 8th grade health class. I personally haven't done anything like this, but I know the way that we are taught to not send pictures isn't very impactful. I think it would serve the purpose more to have kids and teens like themselves tell their stories about how they sent or received pictures, and their consequences. That way, it all seems more real to the kids. On the other hand, if there are kids already experiencing something like this, then they should be allowed to talk to someone without being judged or persecuted because of this. They should be able to get help without any reason to feel ashamed or embarrassed."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

From the article there is a lot of statements of the development on different virtual reality headsets and how much money is made. I assume that the people developing the playstation virtual headset want to make it a better profit from others by being an add on to the playstation console so it won't be so expensive. I agree to the comments below that have positive feedback from their experience on other virtual reality headsets because it makes sense why people like it. But sometimes people shouldn't get carried away with using this technology because it still bad to use since in the past TV was an issue to get close to, and now they put technology directly in front of your face. I'm not saying it's a bad piece of technology but people should take caution on developing virtual reality headsets in the future because it effect's visual sight if it's used a lot. I don't have a thought in mind of a game specifically but I would recommend a game similar to the Alien Isolation franchise. I chose this because it's really suspenseful and challenging and I like games that are like that. The 2 different game modes and their survivor mode and campaign mode. And campaign is my favorite because you need to escape the big space shuttle that you spawn in without getting caught by a fearless Alien roaming around. I have only tried it once and it was amazing I feel like I was actually in the game. I am interested in buying in virtual reality headset because it is awesome and very realistic it made me feel like I was in the game playing shooting looking and all sort of fun stuff.

It would be crazy to catch a football from Tom Brady, tackle Le'Veon Bell, or throw a touchdown pass to Odell Beckham. The possibilities for this game could be endless. I've spent an enormous amount of time thinking about the future of vr and its possibilities and I believe the best game would be an fantasy role playing game. Kinda like Elder Scrolls or Two worlds, an rpg were you can do whatever you wish to do, and with others too.

Virtual reality is so much like real-life, if you have the headset on and fall off a cliff in the virtual reality your body will actually think you fell off a cliff. Basically virtual reality is a big illusion. I would like to see like a The Walking Dead type of virtual reality. That would be so cool to get chased buy a brain eating vicious monster trying to survive. Zombies are like mosquitoes they don't stop until they get what they want. VR looks really cool. I have seen it on youtube. It is like a dream. I would love to see a Call of Duty or a Madden to come out to VR. Another game would be a Star Wars. It is a cool idea. I have not yet used a PlayStation Virtual-Reality headset, but I really want to. If I were to pick any game to play on it it would definitely not Battlefield because that would be too realistic and scary. I would most likely choose GTA 5 because I would want to drive all the cool cars around, run around, and shoot guns every where. A video game that I think they should make a virtual reality game is Grand Theft Auto 5. I think that the older ages around 15 to 20-years-old would love this game to be a virtual reality game. Because instead of sitting in a chair playing the game they would like it better to get up and be able to ride the yellow roller coaster in the game. Or be able to swim in the dark, clear, blue ocean. Not only that they can do a lot of other real life things in Grand Theft Auto that would be much cooler to play in a real life visual. Instead of siting down and playing with a controller looking at a screen. I, at times play video games and I have a lot of games in mind that I would love to see in virtual reality. NBA 2k17 is a very fun game that I play often and would love to experience it in a virtual-reality experience. I bet this experience would have my heart bouncing off the wall in excitement and joy!

Only Arsenal has TWO of them, who hate each other, and the controlling one is a billionaire who married into the richest family in America, but runs his team as if he's a pauper. Granted, they're on a 20 year run of Champions League qualification, but watching Arsenal & Bayern back to back, it's hard to see how Arsenal doesn't extend their streak of losing in the CL round of 16. I wonder how analytics saw the biggest ticket signing, Granit Xhaka? He's drawn two red cards, suspended seven matches, and counting. Last year, newly installed as Gladbach captain? He got three reds, including the first game of the year. Did the analysts see that? I wish Wenger and the analysts well spending 14 hours on today's eyesore. Appropriate that this happened the weekend of Groundhog Day. Arsenal fans have seen this game over and over again. Not strong enough, not committed enough, and not smart enough. It's less about Conte changing system, but more about the players he shunted aside. Ivanovic and Terry, one gone, the other all but. Fabregas a late sub. With Moses and Alonso he has speed on the flanks. Wenger bought Xhaka to bring size, steel and meanness to the center of the park. He's now out on his second red card suspension. No shock, he led the Bundeliga with three last year. The difference between him and Matic is stark. I don't think Chel$ki can be stopped."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Score: 1 And then, of course, there were the Black Loyalists -- slaves who fled through the British lines during the Revolutionary War and took up arms on behalf of the King in return for their freedom. During the negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of Paris, the former owners of these former slaves demanded the return of their property; a demand which their British commanders categorically refused. Eventually more than 3,000 Black Loyalists were evacuated and resettled near what is now the town of Shelbourne in Nova Scotia. Some of their descendants still live there. Although I knew of the history of the Underground Railroad the personal stories and photographs literally breath life into the history. Thank you for forging this story ahead. As a Canadian, I realize we do not share our history well. This Underground Railroad narrative should be proudly shared and told by Canadians and for Canadians. This is so that we further understand how our country came to be. We often engender a taciturn approach and inchoate embodiment of our history, often lacking shared themes. This added layer in our history adds to the mosaic that is Canada's to tell. Our history is as rich as any other country, thank you for helping us celebrate this.

A member of the Johnson clan followed after his runaway banjo band all the way from Arkansas to Canada. When he got there and tried to lure them back with claims of sharing their earnings with the poor musicians, a bunch of Tecumseh's people gathered around him and pinched him blacker than blue. Old Ironsides recognized the old cracker from pre-revolutionary days and rescued him by taking him into his shelter and letting him heal. No way he could travel south blacker than the banjo band he came after. Score: 1 This is fascinating stuff - especially looking in from this country where slavery never existed (Governor Phillip banned it from Day 1, 26/1/1788, because of what he had seen in the then Portuguese colony of Brasil). Yes, Australia had convicts, but once their term was finished they were forever free. Now, the inimitable Michael Moore, in one of his docos called Where to invade next suggests that slavery has been reintroduced via the back door because of the relatively high imprisonment rate of Afro-Americans, and their use as cheap prison labor. Score: 7 it never ceases to amaze me how few americans realize that there are black canadians. even the 'enlightened' jon stewart made a joke about obama arriving in canada for a state visit and being greeted by the governor general--a woman born and raised in haiti. stewart said the black population of canada doubled with the visit. canada's population is about 20% non white and per capita has a larger amount of citizens/legal residents born in other countries than the usa--and isn't alone in that category. this was true before the recent influx of refugees. Score: 9 Follow the Drinking Gourd was the call that slaves, illiterate under pain of death, memorized. It was a verbal road map, the Big Dipper. It meant persevere and head toward the stars of the Dipper - farther and farther from the South - and, ironically, from their real home and family an ocean away in Africa. From slavery in a foreign land to freedom in an even more strange new land - bless the Railroad, its guides, and, most of all, its passengers. And all who flee pain and injustice. The slave story has 2 contemporary echoes - Latinos escaping to the U.S. and Syrians being welcomed to Canada. My grandfather fled Russia and became a valuable citizen back when Jews were not equal in Russia. But poor as they were, as desperate and subject to horrific pogroms, they were not slaves in the Deep South, where Confederate flags still blow in the wind where ashes of lynched and burned black men once roiled the air. Let's lift our lamps beside the golden door to the US, just as Canada did and is continuing to do. I am the son of immigrants, and so is everyone except the First Nations People.

Glad to see that I now have another reason to go back for a visit. Score: 15 Code word for Canada by slaves trying to get here was the promised land. Escaping slaves not only were provided with free farm land but the right to vote. Where I live in Ontario there are many reminders of this migration into Canada including a church in Oro-Modonte (one of two black churches in town) that is being lovingly restored. What irony that in the Globe and Mail a national newspaper in Canada, an article today talks about building another freedom pass from The US to Canada to ensure those fleeing the US have safe entry into our country. I have already written my MP urging him to support this crossing. The US loss is our gain.

In particular, I never dreamed I would see a day when the Underground Railroad would serve as a historical parallel to contemporary events. No way did I ever expect to read reports of asylum-seekers risking frostbite to cross the Canadian border. The land of the free and the home of the brave has been transformed into the land of the cowed and the home of the scared. We actually have two distinct categories of the scared: those who were whipped up to be scared of other people, like Muslims or Latin Americans; and those same other people who scare them.

Score: 2.0 Arsenal's dilemma is becoming increasingly impossible to resolve. On the one hand, switching managers is a huge risk. Arsenal's budget and playing staff does not guarantee a brighter short term future than any of the other big six or seven teams in England, let alone Europe. Manchester United are yet to really show that they have recovered from losing Ferguson. There are very few managers available who wouldn't be considered a big risk. On the other hand, every year seems to make keeping Wenger seem risky too. Like many people who have been in a job for a long time, he has a stubborn sense of how things 'should be done' and seems blind (sometimes wilfully) to the problems of his approach. He can no longer guarantee Champions League football, and every year Arsenal seem to slip further behind its rivals. If Ozil or Sanchez leave this summer, Arsenal might really find themselves in trouble. Stick or twist? Its a decision I am glad I don't have to make. Arsenal has the only billionaire sugar daddy among the top teams in England that does not care, at all, about winning things. The Walmart heiress-in-law only cares about cultivating profit. The other sugar daddy on the board, Ru$$ian-Uzbek oligarch Alisher Usmanov cares deeply about winning, and would be happy to spend up greater $um$ to improve the squad quality, but is hamstrung by his minority stake. In fact, Silent Sam would like nothing more for Usmanov to...just...go...away. And Sir Chips does not listen to the fans. The board is not embarrassed by shows of fan dissent. The only thing that could matter to them would be if there were, oh, say, 10,000+ empty seats at every match. Until the fans walk away from attending, booing the team off the pitch, hiring planes, or other conspicuous but meaningless signs of disaffection will have no effect, zero. Silent Stan will take note of the Champion$ League $ized hole in the revenue line of the balance sheet. But he will see how poorly the post Fergus succession went at the team owned by an American family up in the northwest, and will not want to replicate that issue. But has Wenger done ANYTHING in planning for succession? Why have two of his former captains pursued getting their coaching credentials through Abu Dhabi FC (Paddy Vieira and Mikel Arteta)? Wolfsburg (Andres Joncker)? Is succession Steve Bould or bust? Score: 1.0 Arsenal seem to have reached a plateau under Wenger. The usual top four finish has satisfied his corporate masters, but no major trophies in a long time stokes the fickleness of todays fan, especially a fan of a well-financed club like Arsenal. As a supporter of Arsenal (and the Toronto Maple Leafs; I really know how to pick 'em), the double drubbing by Bayern was the final straw. I've been apprehensive before big games for awhile, as it seems they invariably fall flat. This has to fall at the feet of the manager. Score: 0.0 Brilliant article, which perfectly captures the interminable see-saw battle between the 'In' and 'Out' camps. I'm almost certain he'll stay. There's one big difference this year. For 20(?) years in succession, Arsenal has qualified for the Big One, the European Champions League. They've rarely done well in that competition, a source of irritation to fans, but they've always been there. This year they may not. In fact, today's game against Tottenham could be the decider. Score: 1.0 After watching the NLD today, which clinched Spurs above us, it has to be said: if you looked at the 22 players on the pitch, and had to pick a best XI, I think other than Cech as a push with the much less tested Lloris, I would not pick a single Arsenal player. Without Cech, this one would have been 6-0. Spurs are younger, with a better upside, at every position on the pitch. It also must be said, Harry Kane was in the Arsenal youth system. He sure is better than anything on offer from Arsenal at his position. I guess we will find out how much fun the Europa League is. The absence of Champion$ League payout is the only thing that will get Silent Stan's attention. Score: 2.0 I love Wenger. i have for 20 years since when he was in Japan and all we heard of him was through snippets in rare media reports. He's a brilliant man symbolic of Gallic chivalry, nonchalance, brilliance and determination. But beauty overall. Arsenal has played beautiful football under him. Until it became over-elaborate and then plain useless. Wenger was wrong to invest in unreliable characters and lower his ambitions. Wilshere did not flower, Gibbs never gained his footing, Mertesacker could never step up. Arteta was plain inexplicable. Don't even get me started on Koscielny. Podolski was wasted and I was heartbroken. Wenger needs to dig deep and spend the money they say they have. 200 million on 5-8 people who will renew Arsenal's spirit. There has never been anything wrong with Arsenal's football. Even on that day we were beaten 8-2 in one match by (the hated) ManU. ManU deserved to win, but van Persie missed a penalty and a sitter. What Wenger has lost is his spirit. It is as if he doesn't want to win. Money in the bank and not spent ? What is the purpose ? I looked at my facebook feed But he leaves that faint hope always. They will not win another league under him. A final of the Champions League is beyond their reach under him. He can stay for another year. But he has to transition with a new manager (Koeman or Rogers perhaps) ASAP. This is too hard to bear. Score: 1.0 The transfer policy has been terrible. The best two players he has had, at least since he let Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira walk away, have been savvy pickups off of the Real Madrid and Barcelona discard piles. He let Ashley Cole and Robin Van Persie walk away at their peaks, to direct rivals. His most expensive buy this year, Granit Xhaka, has been abysmal. And the 3 red cards he accumulated this year could not possibly have come as a surprise, as it exactly matches the number he put up last year at Gladbach, including his 1st match of the season, his first as captain. He is an undisciplined discipline nightmare. Did Wenger think he was going to change him. Did he at least think he could dominate a midfield like Vieira could? I understand Arsenal has always been a seller of talent. By 1979, only Pat Rice remained from the 1971 double winners. By then Ray Kennedy had two European Cup winners medals...at Liverpool. After the 1979 landmark FA Cup win over United, the team went to the Final of the Cup Winners Cup, lost in a shootout to Valencia, then sold their two best players, Liam Brady to Juventus, and Frank Stapleton, to United. But these days the team sells, and the replacement talent is of diminished quality. Bacary Sagna out, Mathieu Debuchy in, and Hector Bellerin found by accident? Now he has regressed. Speaking of regression, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson have all gone backwards. Gabriel has only shown intermittent competence. Score: 0.0 Arsene's a great manager who's had his ups and downs, like everyone else does in life. Maybe it's time to leave the Arsenal pressure cooker and embark on a new adventure. He should go and manage PSG. Score: 3.0 Arsene Wenger is, by any metric, the most successful manager in Arsenal's history, by far. But this problem is not Wenger's. At what football club, at the highest level or not, does the manager decide when to go, or to stay on indefinitely. There was one other one, and one only, and he was made a knight of the realm, and won a whole lot more than Wenger did, including the European Cup, twice, and beaten finalists two other times. Arsenal remains one of the richest clubs in the world, although it does not behave that way. The design was to develop Highbury as real estate to finance the construction of the Emirates, home of the highest ticket prices in the land, and the source of the greatest game day revenue in creation. But, against all logic, as the stadium was paid off, the team got less successful, less able to compete in the Champions League, further from a League Championship. From 2006-2008, the team was a losing finalist, and semifinalists in the Champions League. Now it is seven straight dismissals in the round of 16. While losing to Barcelona, they came within a Nicklas Bendtner blown breakaway of winning the tie. Similarly, in Bayern's treble season, they had a Mikel Arteta free kick to win the tie, but he skied it. This year, they outscored Bayern 2-1 in the two 1st halves, and were embarrassed 9-0 in the 2d halves. Why do contemporary Wenger teams capitulate so flagrantly? Why do they defend so poorly, despite his seconds being legendary defenders, Rice & Bould? Score: 2.0 It's crazy how the club has not backed the manager with a Director of Football. I don't know if any Club of the level of Arsenal to let 1 man do so much, it has now become too much. For everything he's done for his club the board needs to step up and support the manager with a much better team and an actual Director. Score: 0.0 As a Chelsea fan, I hope Wenger stays.

It is a sweet and touching reminder of what makes us human. My only negative: the run ends soon and I wish I could see it a few more times to see others in the Everybody role. And I wish the opening monologue from the Usher would be recited in more theaters before the curtain goes up. I actually saw someone who'd just put their phone on vibrate, to turn it fully off - almost worth the price of a ticket in itself. Score: 1 Everybody is inspired by an old theatrical medieval morality genre. It's a play giving us insight into death, which is the final frontier for us all. Leave it to a medieval mind, which presumably saw enough death in its time, to tell us moderners something about which we ignore at all costs. As a line in the play goes, leave it to death to tell us something about life. Go see this play today. Not for the first time, I feel like Ben has seen a different play than I did. I loved Everybody, absolutely loved it. The integration of audience and action reinforced the feeling that we are all in this, however briefly, together until the end. Drawing on Everyman, Jacobs-Jenkins places his work squarely in dramatic history giving it the richness that comes from that history, as well as that which comes from a surprising and inventive fresh look. As for sitting in the dark with the voices our anger, fears, and anxieties, I think this is something we all do to greater or lesser degrees. And, often, the surreal skeletons that emerge here from the darkness are the populace of our dreams. I unfortunately sat towards the front in what would usually be great seats. Ended up having to crane my neck and twist in my seat to see much of what was happening behind me. I get the cleverness us having the audience stare at seats just like the ones we're sitting on (everybody will meet their end), but I wish I had a seat the back of the theater. Would have enjoyed the show more, and been able to watch more of the actors play their parts. Score: 0 I saw this last night and think the review is spot-0n.

Tap, tap, tap out a happy tune on the way to the nearest Whole Foods outlet, eh? Score: 2 Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins is praised despite the middling reception of his play. I recently attended the closing performance of an earlier Jacobs-Jenkins play, Gloria, and I found myself feeling much the same way. It's clear he has talent, but the play seemed to get so much so wrong in terms of theme as well as character. Yet because of the faults, I found that my guest and I had more to discuss afterward than usual. As a play, I give Gloria a C+. As a theatrical experience, it gets a golden A. It's as if Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins knows which ingredients to use, but not quite how to use them. There's talent, to be sure, but how much greater to have students 100 years from now study your works as examples of great literature, and not as conversation starters about what does and doesn't work in the theatre. Best of luck to you, Mr. Jacobs-Jenkins. Score: 4 I saw Everybody on Wednesday night and has high expectations because I loved Octoroon and the playright is so talented and smart. I really enjoyed it as many of the comments here attest. The next night, I saw the Broadway production of Signficant Other. The contrasts were almost like going from President Obama's Administration to President Trump's. It's easy to write a trite play that appeals to the masses, but one that is complicated, caring, intellectually stimulating and makes you uncomfortable in your seat is a challenge I will always be up for and appreciate. I'm thrilled we have Brandon Jacobs-Jenkins in our world right now. Score: 15 beautifully produced, written, directed and performed. witty and deeply moving. Score: 3 Think you were treading lightly trying to analyze a play by this talented playwright. I saw it weeks ago. Actor playing the usher started out interestingly enough. It was downhill from there. It's 90 minutes and you are trapped. Nothing enjoyable about this play. A few times the lights are out and it is pitch black. Sitting in a theatre with perhaps 300+ people (strangers) in that complete darkness is a VERY uneasy feeling. Couldn't find any talent with these actors because the material was that disappointing. Score: 4 As always, one is better off reading Jesse Green than the frustrated, and palpably under-prepared, musings of Brantley. Everybody would be better off if this critic would go the way of Everybody already: theatre critics, too, should metaphorically die after a time. Score: 6 I am glad I saw 'Everybody'. I laughed and wept a few tears and would love to read the text someday because there was a lot to think about. We were still talking about the play the next morning, especially what the play would have been like with a different actor playing Everybody. I do wish the Playbill included photographs of the actors so one could put a name with a face. We should all be so lucky to have Marylouise Burke be Death. Score: 5 Shame on you for revealing so much w/o even a spoiler. This play just upends all of our expectations w. its twists&turns&use of language&staging. Clearly, the playwright has a vision&approach which is outside of the box. The actors who are tasked w. memorizing so many parts are extraordinary&display the element of chance in our lives. The people around me were lauding the play&engaged in animated convos as they exited.

Derek Jeter gone from baseball. Oscar Robertson, gone. In his love of principled sport and sportsmanship, Michael Powell goes to a Navajo reservation to find the inspired, caring principled coach and teens. His ability to find what matters, unique. Similarly, Mr. Powell may be the best writing reporter of The New York Times.

Politics, Obama, Brooklyn, the courts, DAs, prisons, Manhattan, sports - and God knows - have experienced Powell. His next ten years beckon. There is no better - this piece is an epitaph for Dolan and Phil. Both need to read it - as do other onwer in pro sports. Many have thought of buying a team. Few will, for obvious reasons. The players are no longer of Gehrig quality. Did Billy Martin hired and fired 5x start this? Where will it end? Michael Powell can initiate. Others deserving can follow. Chris Chivers, Rukmini Callimachi, Steven Erlanger, Danny Hakim, Gardiner Harris, Jeffrey Gettleman, Margo Fox, there are so, so many. The joyless part is the wizard of oz behind the curtain. When your highest paid player could care less about the well being of the team, does not play much if any, defense, chucks the ball and ignores the rest of the team in favor of doing his own one-on-one playing and doing it so slowly that the defense just sets up to stop him, takes way too many poor shots, what effect do you think that has on the rest of the team. Sucks the energy and the joy of playing right out of them. And the press feeds into this by constantly calling him a great player or the best player on the team. He is a sixth man type player, like Vinnie Johnson was on the Pistons- a shooter you bring in off the bench to try to light it up when you are down by 16. He is a poor, one-dimensional NBA player.

The fans in the Garden are the best and were going nuts. That group plus KP and a good pick (probably at 7) should produce a competitive or at least root-able squad that will hustle back down the court on defense. The Rose trade, the Noah signing, the Melo max, NTC and trade kicker, were unconscionable. Rose is gone. Perhaps there's a Knicksy team that needs a star and will take Melo (I doubt it but maybe.) Phil deserves criticism but at least we have our draft picks and if he can pull off a Melo deal he might still deliver on his promise. Score: 1.0 This Knick team has talent at every position.

The face is that he had the opportunity to sign elsewhere three years ago, but the Knicks could offer the most money. He didn't want to leave any money on the table even though to most people, say $80 million instead of $123 million isn't too shabby. So he doesn't like playing for an awful team and being out of the playoffs. Come on, it looks good on him. He made his $123 milllion dollar bed; now go sleep in it.

If you're trying to run a motion offense that demands unselfishness, Melo is not. Other than the fact that this is the NY media, and fans, I don't understand why Jackson is criticized for noting the obvious about Anthony. No doubt Jackson screwed up with the last contract he gave him - which made no greater sense at the time than it does now. (Rose and Noah made sense - to me at least - have turned into disasters). But Jackson inherited an organization with a 10+ year history of win-now dysfunction. Why is it so wrong to perservere with an offense predicated on unselfish, team-play? For both Melo's sake and that of the Knicks, he must be gone. Then it is up to Jackson to make something work. But old habits die hard - or don't die at all. Score: 1.0 For this Sixers fan, I'm wondering how long I'll have to trust the process? Score: 0.0 What a sad franchise. And how painful for true fans who precede the unending reign of King JAMES. Jackson is certainly not the first, and will no doubt not be the last, of imports that come and go, leaving destructive embarrassment behind. And the common factor for twenty years of failure remains at the rotten top of the heap. As a former lifelong Redskins fan, I've learned that a horrible owner conquers all. Excellent column.

Well if it makes you feel any better, Imitation of Life, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and The Hitchhiker were all cruddy movies too, basic populist drivel and nothing more. Not sure how one could claim this two hour car chase is High Art, but I notice you don't claim that. We walked out of this film after 45 minutes. Let them sell it to China. Score: 4.0 Just saw the flick - and need to remember a very simple principle: its supposed to be FUN. And, while I am none-too-keen on sudden death anymore, the stunts, the setups and even the position was all in line with the popcorn movie I expected. And simply put, it was just a rollicking good time. Score: 2.0 Well this clears something up, I kept reading the movie posters too quickly, thought this was, The Fat and the Furious, a documentary about Trump. With a title like that and a huge explosion on the poster, what else was I supposed to think? I actually like Dwayne Johnson, Charlize Theron, and Jason Statham a lot, but I'd rather see them in movies that made sense or had some sort of point to them. A college friend of mine was actually in a batch of this endless franchise (John Ortiz) and I like him too, but couldn't force myself to go see these anyway. It does sound like a terrific movie for the extremely slow-witted though, so I expect it'll do well in America. Score: 7.0 We howled with laughter and disbelief all the way through this movie. Have seen all of the FF movies at least twice and really love this franchise, but this one was by far the most ridiculous and implausible, with some of the worst dialogue ever written. The uneven tone of this film has it veering wildly, like one of its hacked, self-driving cars inflicting random mayhem in its haste to join other zombie autos. Substituting for writing, they try to grab audiences by seeing how many familiar movie and TV stars they can rope in (and under-utilize). The family tropes are parodied instead of reinforced. Emotional conflict is lost in the smoke and mirrors. Going back to the early films in this series: they were smaller, less ambitious, and imbued with melancholy. The characters struggled, scraping by to save up to build themselves a really good car. Odds were stacked against them: they were people just outside the law, people of color, women struggling for respect in racing, everyone just managing to scrape by. Now they're rich people working for the government. Cars are no longer the beloved, precious objects they worked so hard on, but replaceable, fancy toys that are casually tossed aside or blown up. Noise and chaos swallows ideas, emotions, and relationships, making everything implausible. Once-human characters are cartoon super heroes, throwing the emotional disconnect switch. This new FF film merely demonstrates how big money infects and distorts values. Score: 2.0 I was taken to the movie against my will. It was loud, violent and involved physically threatening an infant which crosses a moral line in movies for me. I was also in the minority everyone around me (ok it was mostly 11 year old boys at the matinee) thoroughly enjoyed the over the top action. Charlize plays a cold hearted killer very naturally and from a new movie preview it looks like she is making a good living acting to type in her next role. Score: 4.0 This franchise is great fun because of its absurdity and heart, as Dargis points out. The driving sequences are almost characters unto themselves. They're not car chases, they're more like the driving equivalent of a martial arts sequence, and thus feel three-dimensional and somewhat surreal. As For Mad Max: Fury Road, it was a masterpiece of beautifully choreographed filming. Call it a cinematic ballet - that's what it reminded me of. It's helpful to think of it in the context of the Mad Max origins; it steps outside of any conventional realm and stands on its own as a hideous and beautiful object. Carnivalesque grindhouse. Not for everyone, perhaps, but unique and extraordinary. Score: 1.0 Having watched Mad Max: Fury Road for about 15 minutes, I can only imagine this film won't be something in my wheelhouse. The scenes grow baroque - love it. It evokes go for broke, which is language one would expect about a car chase, but turns it on its side. Seemingly mindless enthusiastic praise turned dry-humored critique. I got a chuckle out of it. Score: 2.0 Surprisingly, my main issue with the franchise is that I'm not thrilled by the driving sequences. I enjoy the car chases in Bond, Mission Impossible, Transporter, and Bourne better. I also enjoy the driving in stuff like Need for Speed and Gone in 60 Seconds more. I am into cars, driving, and racing. The Fast and Furious movies are more about admiring cars than about skilled fast driving. I am always happy to see innovative car and car chase scenes. I think the chase in Spectre is terrific. I could watch that for 30 minutes. I'm THAT mindless. But nothing in any Fast and Furious film compares. It's COOL to drive a car from one skyscraper through another into another, but that's not the same as a masterfully edited car chase scenes showing great driving chops like slalom skiing. It's more auto worship than auto play. Score: 5.0 Is Charlize Theron in financial straits? Other than being offered an insane amount of money, why would an actor of her many talents be associated with this so-called movie/big budget commercial? I get it, but then I don't. Surely a question for the ages. Score: 8.0 I bet that its a fun set to be on. And then there's the insane money. Way back Michael Caine was asked how an actor of his stature could do Jaws3. His response: three weeks work, $500,000. Score: 2.0 This is not a mystery. If you could make a big pile of money pretending to be a hacker in a movie, why wouldn't you? Did you see that pseudo-feminist apocalyptic piece of garbage she made involving virgin-carrying semi truck-racing? Inexplicably, that thing won awards. It's all about the benjamins. More power to her. I'd do this movie in a heartbeat, then retire. But I'm not Charlize Thron, so I'll just clock in at the office instead. Score: 4.0 There are rumors that Daniel Day Lewis and Meryl Streep may sign on for the next installment. I smell a Best Picture nod! Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron in Fate and Furious?

LaVine might not be exactly a household name just yet but he is a very talented player and will be an all-star one day. He's much more than a just dunker, though, like most young players in the league, he a has a long way to go before he can consistently play good defense. There is something intriguing about the lesser name guys doing the dunks. Reminds of the city park legends who never made it to the big show, but had incredible skills. Seems more real, somehow. AG probably should have won with the dunk pictured here, but it looks like he'll be able to take it this year. The big surprise is Deandre Jordan's participation. Like the article mentions, most key veteran players don't play because of too many hard landings. Jordan is a big guy, a center, and he could easily hurt himself in the competition.

I'm glad the Yankee's aren't participating. The upcoming season is what counts, their priorities and focus are perfectly correct. The WBC should follow the same approach that FIFA uses for the World Cup, tiggest sporting event around: Play at the end of the season, with the tourney starting in mid- to late November. That will give players a chance to recuperate after the MLB season and time to recover for the following season. There's always an injury risk, including during the dozens of spring-training games. Some argue that the World Baseball Classic doesn't want to compete with the NFL or even college football, so it avoids fhe fall. So why not play the early-round games during the week? The knockout round and final games would surely be of interest even on a weekend. The WBC has potential--who wouldn't want to see a genuine tourney featuring the best players? But the American players have to care. I find it shameful that so many of them choose club over country, unlike their Latin American and Asian peers. Again, if soccer can make it work, as it has since 1932, then so can baseball. How many soccer greats have suffered a cataclysmic injury during a World Cup and ruined the following season? It can happen, but that doesn't stop the world's best from representing their country and competing. So as baseball fans we should all support the WBC and hope that they move the event to the fall. It would work. Just ask FIFA. Noah Synnderggard is right The only emotion I feel for the WBC is annoyance that it interferes with MLB spring training. Score: 0 I love the WBC because Israel is in it. Does anyone know when they play or against whom? Baseball fans root for their teams from generation to generation. The Olympic experience demonstrated they will not switch their allegiance to the country as a whole especially when the risk of injury makes the rosters seem second rate. Therefore, it seems to me the way to market it is not to the country as a whole but to individual pockets of Americans who have specific rooting interests, for example certain ethnic groups, certain players, or perhaps add wrinkles or rule changes which would make purists curious. For example, let players taken out of the game come back in (might that reduce injuries, and since these guys commit their time it seems silly to limit them to pinch running)? Or make the games 7 innings, or use a high school type DH rule allowing the DH to hit for a position player instead of or in addition to the pitcher. Remember where the three points shot came from in basketball or the shoot out in hockey-other leagues. Now they're an integral part of the sports we love. Just some thoughts from a huge baseball fan who watches the WBC avidly. (that's go blue and white for those who don't speak Hebrew) There will be a day when the winner of the MLB 'World' Series ( one of the most narcissistic terms in sports we Americans use) cannot beat the best team from some other country or a team comprised of other nationalities. Oh my word, what will the commissioner do? Score: 3 This article perfectly explains what I've been so frustrated about the WBC, the US star players' indifference about it. It seems US pro baseball players have little to no sense of sacrifice, outside of their own paychecks. Hockey and soccer players would consider it an honor to wear their nation's jersey, but not MLB players. No tradition there, and Syndergaard's comment said it all. It's all about me and the team who signs my paycheck. Score: 0 Come to think of it why do fans care about their home teams either? How does the NY Mets or Yankees winning or not winning game affect the average fan's income, career potential, family health, relationships with friends and family, etc? Score: 12 The overwhelming majority of US baseball fans couldn't care less about the WBC. We don't care who wins. Most fans wish they would just do away with it. Their main concern is having one of their team's players getting injured. Ask Mark Teixeira. Our rooting interest is with our teams. A Cub fan wouldn't trade their World Championship for a dozen WBC championships. It's a contrived event by MLB. Score: 2 In 1999, florence, italy, Cuba and China met for the championship in the baseball world cup. There was ONE american in attendance, the head of the players' union. The owners either did not care, or were unaware of its world wide significance. Finally, when they realised it could be marketed into a media friendly money maker they took it over, renamed it the classic , and acted like they had just discovered it. Now they are in a quandary over its importance. The conflicts with spring training, possibility of injuries, money issues as well as players' lack of interest, and more, have made it less appealing to the major leagues.  Fortunately we can still visit other countries and see the game played at a pretty high and enjoyable level. With many players foreign (to them) adding to the rosters. Keep those passports handy. Score: 10 I would simply conclude : the USA are not the greatest nation in Baseball. The proof is they can't win the WBC,. Score: 0 The US is afraid to compete with other countries. Score: 8 It is ironic how, in an article about the non-participation of top-line American players in the World Baseball Championship, the writer twice uses the term World Series in referring to the US championship. Especially after American players chicken out of testing their mettle against the world's best. If we had been even competitive in the former iterations of the WBC, I bet they'd be fighting to get on the team. Face it, we are sore losers. Pity, because the rest of the baseball world will be loving it. Score: 9 The US won't field their best team because they know they will lose anyway. Instead, let's just call our finals the World Series. Indeed, that's the American way. Score: 5 Let's face it: the world baseball classic just has no place to exist. The great players are all professionals who play in the major leagues and must prepare themselves for the regular season of 162 games. This is what they get paid for this is what they have trained for their entire lives. Ball players are not in shape before spring training and they are too exhausted after the regular season to play in another round of baseball games. That leaves no time period for which the WBC to take place. All of the best players from all of the countries in the world already happen to play in the major leagues with the exception of an occasional Korean or Mexican or Japanese player or Cuban. And we can expect to see more of those players from those countries in the major-league soon. The thought of having Gary Sanchez or Noah Syndergaard or Mike Trout seriously injured in the WBC is abhorrent to even the casual fan. That leaves the WBC as a sideshow populated by retreads, players long past their prime, and mediocre players like Ike Davis playing for the Israeli team. That may make for cute stories in the news about Mike Piazza 'S roots in Italy. The WBC, along with Esperanto, Olympic Golf, and the XFL is a misbegotten mistake. Score: 3 The WBC is an utter waste of time, the fantasy creation of MLB which fails to understand how useless it is because, of course, it's its own creation. MLB's defense of this sideshow reminds me of the story of The Emperor's New Clothes. MLB is so infatuated with itself and its creation that it refuses to see what everyone else can see. If U.S. fans could care less about the event, let's drop out entirely, including banning MLB level players from other countries playing in it. Score: 5 Why have the last two baseball commissioners been so annoying? Mr. Selig ignores the bulging Popeye forearms of his home run hitters for years and years until, surprise, surprise, the truth starts to turn up here and there before the floodgates open and he gets anti-PED religion. He boasted about attendance when there was all of 1.5% increase in attendance between 2001 and 2014 and a 6% drop between 2008 and 2014. Now we have Commissioner Manfred claiming that the fans want shorter games and proposing all sorts of irrelevant changes, some cosmetic and some fundamental, in pursuit of that personal goal of his. Ever heard a Red Sox or Yankee fan complain about the length of games between their two teams, often coming down to nail-biting endings whatever their length? On top of that, we have a commissioner who, like his predecessor, inexplicably schedules a series of games requiring teams artificially constructed based on the passport the player holds (or that his grandmother or grandfather holds/held) to fly all over the world in March to play games with teammates who have not practiced together. And this is supposed to be some sort of tippy-top quality event that we're all supposed to go gaga over? This product is right up there with the quality of product provided to Wile E. Coyote by the Acme Co. With any luck, the ratings will go down the tubes, and MLB teams will not have their normal spring training regimen upset by this non-event in 2021. Score: 4 The WBC is an exhibition. It is way too early for pitchers to have extended outings. Score: 5 There is only one tournament that matters. It's played in October and called the World Series. MLB needs to stop marketing its product by copying other sports whether it be instant replay from the NFL or WBC from soccer. It's not the World Cup.

Last night I watch Team Japan's game on TVl last night. But Japanese players playing in MLB don't take part to WBC. We want to watch games to play seriously on global teams. If United States can't join it seriously, WBC should not be held. MLB should not think baseball can be played globally. If MLB can, they must try to do games like soccer Europe Champions League. MLB must rethink it's tight schedule of regular season. We want to watch serious games around international. Score: 0 If the US players are so disinterested, then don't hold it at all.

The truth is that only a truly strong person can admit that they do not have all the answers and that at moments they may be needy.

Thirst, by contrast, is self-serving, reactionary, and (in some cases) spawned from narcissism and fear. The problem with thirst is that it is a juvenile behavior; unregulated, sure, but also emanating from a less-evolved place inside oneself, a basic instinct. And while thirst is rejected here as a purely negative trait -- likely because it makes people uncomfortable when they recognize their own desires and needs laid bare in others -- perhaps it need not be. Thirst for knowledge, for professional achievement, and for athletic accomplishment are self-serving but are generally positive traits and revered in many circles. It trips the alarms when it is grossly executed, harmful, or triggers embarrassment in the witness.

Still other recipes, like the one illustrated in the Helen Mirren movie The Hundred-Foot Journey call for a pinch of Garam Masala and a pinch of turmeric.

This is particularly striking if you realize this so-called threat is unlikely to materialize in the US soil if you leave the North alone (contrary to the threats from Middle East). In all the leaders concerned President Moon is the only person who takes human lives in jeopardy seriously. Score: 1 I am not a Trump supporter; however I do not have a problem with his bellicose statements in response to Kim's flagrant belligerence. Your comment that that Moon was possibly being placating towards Trump as opposed to generally supportive of his approach feeds ammunition to critics who claim biased news coverage. This diminishes the potency of all the legitimate criticism of Trump policy proposals and investigations. Stick with the facts; let them speak for themselves without the overly subjective opinions. Score: 0 Mr. Moon are now in three campaigns. On the foreign policy front, he needs to convince President Trump of the United States of his North Korea policy's desirablity. Sensing the reality TV celebrity turned president's desire to be taken seriously and admired, Mr. Moon appears to give him what it takes to propel his policy agenda: a charm offensive of gratifing Trump's ego.  The caveat here is that Mr. Moon has no control over where his personal appeal to Trump will make its way to since Trump's unpredictablity applies with friendly forces as well as hostile forces. The second one is that although Mr. Moon inherited a huge staunch following from ill-fated President Roh, he needs to make a differentiation from two predecessors, including Roh. To lay the groundwork for bipatisan North Korea policy, Mr. Moon should ward off McCarthyism attacks from conservatives by showing his policy toward North Korea is based on robust military readiness and ironclad alliance with the U.S. To turn around skeptics, he should launch himself into a campaign of mollifying security concerns. Lastly, he has handle with the parliament's largest opposition thag is still licking their wounds in sustained from presidential impeachment of Ms. Park in the form of approval ratings in tatters. The Frustrated yet vindictive opposition party appears hell-bent on looking for any weakness or missteps for fervant polical attacks. How to cope will be an enduring challenge for his time in office. Asia compliments mean just the opposite but that is good enough for Bubba Trump to bragging about. What's clear is Mr. Moon has moved away from the US by directly negotiate with the North and suspend the future deployment of non-functional THAAD missile defense system as public opinion showing only 15% of South Korean(a drop from 50% before the election) has confidence in the Dotard's ability to resolve the current crisis. Score: 1 I am glad that South Korean leader is stoking ego of the POTUS and not of the little rocket man. The South Koreans have been stoking egos of their northern brothers or henchmen for too long. And there can be no doubt - whether you like it or not - the quality of conversation on North Korea has shifted. It has shifted from understanding it's concerns to a recognition that it is a menace to the world. The conversation had also shifted on China's complicity - and it has laid bare China's illicit support and trade with this sick little puppy. And the South Korean leader was wise to praise the POTUS since the North Koreans told them that their missiles are aimed at U.S. and not at them. That frees U.S. from taking a military action when the little rocket man makes another attempt to threaten our country. So, it's in the interests of the South to calm down the little rocket man - otherwise they will become collateral damaged goods. I'm reluctantly entertaining the idea that maybe Trump's volatility in and of itself deserves credit. Of course it's too early to tell where this would ultimately lead, if anywhere, but I remember a New Yorker article several months back that described North Korean officials puzzling over Trump's intentions behind each tweet. For decades the status quo endured - occasional saber rattling, food sent for placation, NK reasonably confident that no POTUS would ramp up the pressure - but now that Trump has tossed the playbook, NK is improvising along with us and there's opportunity for development. A potentially horrific development, many argue, and Trump's gamble is certainly dangerous (assuming for a dubious minute that his blustering tweets are calculated). On the other hand, Japan was pleasantly surprised by the POTUS directly addressing the abductions for the first time in living memory. China has vacillated in its continued sending of aid to NK. Maybe Mr. Moon is banking on flattery, but then again, maybe he appreciates South Korea being an active part of the good cop-bad cop routine. Maybe a lasting change, and a desirable one at that, could come out of this. Stranger things have happened; Nov 8 2016 comes to mind. Flattery always works with Trump. His ego is shining!!!

Score: 3 Don't scare Trump-haters with this article. Life is tough enough as it is without having to digest the idea Trump can achieve something better than his less crazy predecessors. And if the Palestinians should suddenly quietly return to the negotiating table for real this time with their tails between their legs now knowing their whining rope-a-dope game is over as demonstrated by Trump's Jerusalem affirmation, with Obama gone and Trump not giving a rat's rear end what the UN or Sweden thinks, my suggestion is to keep sharp objects away from Trump-haters for their own good. Even keep them away from high buildings just in case they totally lose it mentally. Score: 7 Trump's only policy genius to date is to make everyone else - dingbat Republicans and even Kim Jong-Un - seem almost reasonable by comparison. Kim Jong-Un seized on that earlier by making a show of having his generals present a plan to fire missiles into the sea around Guam and then ostentatiously declining to pursue it, and recently in making his overtures to the south regarding the Olympics. Trump, playing true-to-type, overlooked the significance of this and instead focused on the nuclear button comment. Giving Trump credit, one would imagine, is President Moon's method of trying to give Trump the feeling that he has a stake in these nascent talks and potentially avoid further incendiary Tweets that might derail those talks. The danger in this instance is that Trump, taking the flattery as genuine, might actually believe that his childish taunting was brilliant statecraft and thereby be encouraged to engage in more of it. This is akin to trying to break up a dogfight by pulling the dogs apart and immediately giving them a steak; it might help temporarily, but will only serve as Pavlovian reinforcement for the bad behavior in the long run. Score: 0 North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons were not built to attack South Koreans, Chinese or Russians, but were \u201caimed solely at the United States.\u201d North Korea' top negotiator spelled out Kim's objective in a nutshell. You can't get any clearer than that. It tells you his nuclear weapons program is non negotiable. It's his insurance policy against possible U.S. attack. The purpose of opening talks with North Korea is to keep Kim from doing anything rash and to assure him the tweets coming out of the White House is just all that. Tweets. Hoping to persuade him to give up his nukes is a fool's errand. The only way the North Korean nuclear crisis will get resolved is for the U.S. to withdraw it's troops out of South Korea and Japan which is never going to happen or wait for the Kim dynasty to collapse which is bound to happen. South Korea, U.S. and China are better off focusing their energy on planning and coordinating for that eventuality. Score: 2 There is a not so subtle difference between Credit and Caused. Crediting Trump for this is like crediting the Governor of Michigan for all the new water lines in Flint. Or crediting Roy Moore for laws against pedophiles. People shouldn't use the word credit when a pejorative is more factual. Score: 1 Nothing has actually happened yet. If a year passes with productive discussion then the world can be thankful.

Of course, it seems also necessary to point out that North Korea is the only country on the planet less trustworthy than our current President. Score: 1 Mr. Moon's comment on Mr. Trump's contribution to the peace talks is not simply a tactful maneuver or a diplomatic flattery. Mr. Moon's approach to North Korea is not much different from Mr. Trump's. They both believe in the strategy of whip and carrot toward North Korea. I know it is easy to get an impression that Mr. Trump is a hawkish fool from his provocative words against North Korea. Yet Mr. Trump has been in full support of the peace talks between the Koreas putting his trust on Mr. Moon.

Could it be North Korea for once is finally actually scared of a US president who won't roll over like Clinton or Obama or sluff the problem off on six-party talks like W. A president who doesn't take advice from Nicholas Kristoff, either? President Moon: careful what you want cuz you ain't seen nothin' yet. Accidents can happen, and they're not all bad, even if it's caused by the most abominable person. In leadership as in business, in the end it's the bottom line that ultimately counts -- not how you got there. Talk the talk only works for a short time. History coldly judges results only. This is why Obama will be judged harshly by history despite his smooth eloquence while Trump still has a chance of ultimately being considered a good president -- just as crazy irascible Andrew Jackson is considered now. Score: 14 President Moon Jae-in of South Korea understands that flattery will get you everywhere with Trump. Score: 1 Waiting for the fun when foreign leaders' deny they ever credited Trump for anything after Trump's indictment for obstruction of justice.

The Night Of is a terrible example. It involved a man with a history of violence who was accused of stabbing a woman to death. He was arrested with the bloody knife on him. Score: 2.0 I hope the idea of building new jails is not a job creation scheme. Other cities and states have gone down thus unsustainable path which requires a continuous pipeline of inmates to sustain. Any workable solution to conditions at Rikers Island must address the issue of bail, which most inmates cannot afford, as the article acknowledges. Even people who are eventually found not guilty of any crime can spend months and years detained in Rikers' dangerous environment simply because they cannot afford bail. This is costly in terms of City dollars and in physical, mental and emotional damage to inmates, some of whom are innocent. Addressing the bail issue would necessarily reduce the jail population. Still there are some dangerous and unsavory people at Rikers who need to be there. It is difficult to see how closing this facility and opening small jails in neighborhoods is a solution. No one, not just wealthy gentrifiers in Park Slope, wants a jail in their neighborhood. Less affluent New Yorkers are tired of disproportionately absorbing the City's problems. Reduce the population of Rikers by addressing the bail issue. Rather than spending money to build new jails, allocate those funds to restore the court system to sufficient and efficient operation.

This was a long standing principle, notwithstanding the historic monumental failure to abide by it. Hence, the terms, correction,  correctional facility, etc. Score: 1.0 Many people do not understand the difference between jail and prison. Jail is where people are held BEFORE trial (mostly because they simply cannot make bail and a small number who hare serving sentence less than one year.) They have NOT been found guilty of any crime, they have merely been accused. Prison is where people are sent after they have been found guilty of a crime. Make prisons as tough as you want but jails should be a different matter. As for closing Rikers I think it is a mistake and a hidden plan for new real estate development. Sure the Brooklyn house of detention is in a pricey neighborhood, but much of that development happened while the jail was closed. The reality is any new jails will be built in poor neighborhoods because the wealthy have the resources to block new jails in their neighborhoods.

Perhaps but keep in mind that prisoners from that central facility are making court appearances in all five boroughs on a daily basis. Let's face reality here. The biggest prison will be built in east New York. And there will be no powerful opposition. Is it sensible to cite a fictional TV series to illustrate an important point about a serious issue in the justice system?

Perhaps you will not have a professional life but if we ever needed more eyes on the world AND FOREIGN EYES REPORTING ON THEIR OWN COUNTRIES The ones who work hard and have talent will make it. The others have a right to try. Having worked for a wire service, a newspaper, and magazines I find many complaints come from people who lost their safety net (wires and papers and magazines). Can you make a living at this? There are people who are and do and will. Will it be everyone? But does that mean people shouldn't try? Of course they should try. Understand it's a business, you must produce powerful work and be fearless. It's a roll of the dice but try. Score: 6 I've now had a chance to read the interview with Donald R. Winslow as well as the interview with Leslye Davis. And, both photojournalists have valid points. However, despite the fact that Leslye is more of an optimist and Donald is more of a pessimist on the state of photojournalism, each are arriving at their conclusion by focusing on different points. While Leslye Davis is celebrating the fact that the playing field has become more accessible in regards to gender, race and social status, Donald Winslow is trying to point out the devaluation of creativity. And, I think that despite Leslye's optimism, she needs to open herself up to Donald's points. Photographers, whether they work in photojournalism or advertising, are not valued as much as they were in the past. And, media companies and advertising agencies are looking at new and creative ways to reduce budgets to increase profits. Hiring a jack-of-all-trades photojournalist/video journalist/writer was created to save money. Hiring a local photojournalist as opposed to shipping someone out on assignment was done to save money. I may be a pessimist myself when I say that the playing field has opened more to satisfy profitability than to satisfy a moral obligation. Because, when it comes down to the core; everything can be tied to money and the rest is just conversation. And, creative fields, like photojournalism have become very susceptible to this process of devaluation. Score: 2 I really hope that Leslye will be in Perpignan this year. A lot of people in this profession need to hear this. Score: 5 A newly released study says 85% of those photojournalists entering World Press who responded to a poll reported they make less than $40,000 annually. 66% percent say they are happy with their careers. So, both of the interviewees make good points, but Winslow's reflections benefit from observations over a lengthy career and more closely align with the reality 'on the ground' and not just from those who went straight from college to a Manhattan office tower - and hadn't suffered through the most turbulent period in media business history. Score: 1 Was glad to read Davis, at one point, noting that the place where she has worked her entire career so far is a newspaper with more resources than most people have... I realize we are lucky here. The original Q&A with Winslow for me was as much about smaller-town print media newspapers as well as outlets with a great many more budgetary challenges than the NYT when it comes to foreign coverage. And this is why I was so hoping to work with you when you interviewed in Chicago, Leslye. Your determination, spirit, talent and willingness to explore every new avenue totally hit the mark. You will be a great mentor to the next generation. Score: 3 Lesley Davis is my new hero. I was part of that golden age, at least the very end of it. It was thrilling and important, helping my communities better understand themselves. It was also staggeringly limiting - sometimes you needed to hear someone's voice to understand, sometimes you needed to see how someone moved within their realm to understand. We can do that now. For many years, we took the easy route, covering the obvious events for our daily deadlines. Every you now and then, we'd get to do the deep dive story and really be a full fledged Storyteller. Today, social media feeds fill the need of the instantaneous this-is-happening void. We, who are devoted to the craft, can now focus on the Why, not just the What, the How that explains the Where and the When. We get to deal with the Who as a complete portrait, not just a two-dimensional series of inked dots. The golden age of photojournalism, limited to and by those who had access to the gold, has passed. In its place we get to build an organic, comprehensive and democratically necessary era of visual storytelling. And that phrasing is specific - we need to Build this. There are many challenges, but isn't that what photojournalist deal with everyday? Score: 1 Amazing story! I loved and agreed with everything but especially the comment about everyone being a writer and photographer, democratization of photography - who gets to tell the story. Score: 7 Bless you for your sunny optimism, Leslye. Alas, it doesn't change the sad truth that, for my students, the odds of earning a middle class income as a photojournalist have become similar to the odds of doing so as an actor. I don't discourage them; how do you tell young people not to dream? And someone has to fill those few stable jobs that remain. With hard work, talent and some breaks, why not them? But I do tell them--as any good theatre teacher would tell their students--of the long odds of success. To call this simply 'change' is a bit dismissive, perhaps. I would further submit that, as a society, we have not benefitted from the decline of professional journalism or from the rise of 'citizen' journalism. And without a robust mass media, with all of its faults, Margaret Bourke-White and Dorothea Lange might never have achieved massive audiences for their work, recognition of their special skill, craft and talent or their status as role models for both women and men (myself, for instance) who aspired to excellence. Democratization and fragmentation are poor trade-offs, in my judgement, for that. Score: 3 I would say, if you have the passion to tell stories there will be a place for you.

This all makes perfect sense. I think we have gotten so far away from our human roots, to our own detriment. Now we sit for hours in front of a computer, in front of a TV screen, whereas our ancestors were busy all day fetching water, farming, hunting, cooking, etc. They awoke with the sun and began to quiet down when the sun went down, more or less rising and retiring according to the sun and moon.

Sure, you can have the best design but if commuting is brutal and long, even the best office will not do it. It is about time to rethink many aspects of our modern life. When we hire, where candidates live is important to us. If their commutes are long, it makes no sense to us. From our experience, it won't last long.

Racism, environmentalism, equal opportunity, affirmative action and gender equality, all these are at core of liberalism but all I have seen is superficial actions. Back to the topic, the concentration of offices in big cities makes no sense to me, especially with everything in cloud now. However, I don't think work from home is a good idea either. I think the solution is to have many satellite offices around the country. By doing so, more talents can be recruited. This can cut cost and benefit smaller communities too. Of course team work is essential and we don't want to divide a team to many different locations. It may make more sense to diversify locations based on functions.

I always felt pride in entering the offices when I returned from my business trips. On many occasions we staged national sales meetings at our offices or had important clients visit. We never failed to receive numerous compliments on how attractive the offices and workspaces looked. It seemed obvious to anyone who visited our facilities that our employees were extremely proud to work for TOA and took pride in their duties.

Score: 1.0 Seems like a local trend. The Champions League is as exciting as ever. Score: 3.0 The Euros were low-scoring likely because all major tourneys tend to be low-scoring. Look esp at World Cup history. When the competition tightens, teams tend to play defensively, leading to fewer goals. Something has to be done to open up the game, if the powers want more goals--debatable, since the conservative instinct to not mess with a money-making good thing seems to hold sway. If half the field open to offsides calls was narrowed--say, to the 18 yds between the goalline to the front of the penalty box--then play should open up enuf to obtain the desired increase in goals, and might enuf to change a few coaches minds about defensive tactics.

But of the top 4 teams as of this moment, Hoffenheim and Dortmund press (though Dortmund does so much less than they did under Klopp), and Bayern is well, Bayern. Those packing teams noted, Koln, Frankfurt, et. al., are just not up to Champions League qualification standard, and might even fall short of Europa League qualification. The teams are scrambling to avoid being dragged into the relegation scrap. The promoted teams from two years ago both look doomed in Darmstadt and Ingolstadt, and the rest are searching for a way to avoid the relegation playoff. Ironically, defense is worse throughout the Bundesliga. Dortmund wouldn't be stuttering in fourth if their defense was more solid. Tuchel's switch to a back three has failed to solidify the defense, and Roman Burki hasn't turned out to be much better than Roman Weidenfeller. And Leverkusen's defense has been like a sieve all year, and Omer Toprak, bound for Dortmund, doesn't look like he is helping Leverkusen, nor does he look like the answer for Dortmund going forward, either. Of course, the emerging back line star, Hoffenheim's Niklas Sule, has been snapped up by Bayern, where he might not trouble a Hummels-Boateng partnership.

Once you do that, then implementing your disciplined savings strategy becomes critical. I have always been good with money, not that I have made a lot of money in the stock market or anything like that, but I know how to save, and plan for the future. Though I retired early from my public education career, I felt I'd be fine as I had been working in a part time job for a few years before I retired. I actually had two part time jobs that were both interesting and helped me supplement my income. I usually have some kind of savings goal, which I have now surpassed though my income has recently been severely cut back as my part time jobs have been either eliminated or diminished in scope. I fear depleting my savings, so I'm determined to spend less. I have socked away funds in a small portfolio which I can access in about a year---though half of that is ear marked for my two grandchildren's college fund, even though it won't cover more than a small fraction of what a good school might cost. I wish I had a bit more money to spend on those grandchildren, but I am also determined to do with less. In fact, I kind of enjoy the idea of simplifying and appreciated all I do have. Certainly, keeping our eyes cautiously on the budget is the most important thing for all humankind to survive in this era, given how unpredictable our future is -- emergency came up unexpectedly. It seems harmless to squander at our early ages which makes as confidante enough, and hence, we didn't take a blown until we grew up and consequently fell apart by the inundated and avalanche of debts and massive inabilities to pay, for example, collage's tuition. My personal experience illustrates how wasteful it is to spend money thoughtlessly without a long-lived plan and refraining ourselves from spending on insignificant stuffs. I could remember correctly when I was in both high and undergraduate school, I was excessively burden and heavy loads on my parents' shoulder; I was totally spendthrift and wasting money in trivial and excessively ordinary and inconsequential stuffs. In addition to asking them a slew of bucks endlessly, I didn't considered having a saving account to put some of them or even ironically a tiny fraction for any unforeseen situations. However, that unfortunately didn't stopped there. I got a job where I can earn an adequate money and thrive solely by my own, but I ended up indeed after having served two years in my company miserable, bleak and eventually confused about what to do to keep myself in the save net.

Score: 0 There are alot of way to commit an act of resistance. Resistance is when you refuse to accept or when you go against law or something simple. For example you can use music, speeches, protest and art. Although the most popular one is speeches and protest, you can use art as an act or resistance. There are time where art can mean different and have deeper meaning. Art is protesting without violence and such. Some people are not good with words but are better with art. In which case they can use art to express how they feel toward the society. Like the black lives matter shirt or art. By showing that art or wearing it u are protesting but in art form, no violence. Like how we talk about in class some time you can really say what you want to cause it can get you in trouble but in art form you can. Like how color mean different thing you can use color to tell deeper meaning to what you are against. Art can most definitely be a form of resistance. One of the most notable movements of resistance is BlackLivesMatter. Many people expressed how they felt about the treatment the black community was receiving by not only voicing their opinions but physically expressing it through murals. The art displayed by said people definitely did not go unseen, it shed light on a tough problem in society today and was anything but ignored. It opened the eyes of people who may not understand the stand point and experiences of people of color. I feel that society and people today in the US have taken great steps in uniting cultures, but we\u2019ve also taken some steps back. With more shared culture through art whether it be movies, poems, or books, we can come together as a culturally inclusive country. Art is the sole foundation of societal change. Everything that is created to stir society into an act of resistance, or cultural change, is melted into an always stirring pot called Art. Art is books, it is poems, it is political cartoons, speeches, quotes, inventions, crafts and so much more; it is the basis of all change in Society. Everything that has happened in any society has been because of art; wars because of inventions, national uproar because of speeches, historical discoveries because of books, bias because of cartoons\u2026 The world revolves around this axis, even though we do not attribute art to it. When you really delve into the true meaning of art, it sticks out that maybe, just maybe, art is just a definition of anything that moves us. When I think of art, and I let the word sit in my head for a while, it is impossible not to think of cathedral ceilings and gold, marble and hushed voices. It is impossible not to think of museums and no-photographs-please, velvet ropes and polished frames. When we think of art, we are conditioned to see it in its highest form - art, to some Americans, is nothing but a portrait of a half-smiling woman, and the dozens of replicas that mimic it, like ghosts. Art is not supposed to be high-and-mighty. When we condition ourselves to see art as a \u201cdo-not-touch\u201d, \u201cno-photographs-please\u201d, tidy exhibit free of dust and oxygen, we take away its humanity. Art is supposed to be human. Art is graffiti adorning the sides of buildings like angry red ivy. Art is blurry photos and terrible poems. Art is the opportunity that humans give themselves to let their souls go, whether it\u2019s on a canvas, or through a lense, or with a pen and paper. Art can be resistance. Art should be resistance - humans are rebellious creatures, and art should reflect such. Art can be anything you want it to be - but please, for the love of all things, do not let it become a luxury. Score: 1 Art has always been a vehicle for resistance. It is true that owning art or purchasing tickets to see a performance costs money, and that in this sense art can be called a \u201cluxury.\u201d However, art has transcended wealth to inspire change throughout history. In the baroque period, the artist Artemisia Gentileschi indicted an assaulter through her paintings of Judith slaying Holofernes. In colonial America, Paul Revere crafted an engraving that transformed the \u201cBoston Massacre\u201d into a symbol for the British government\u2019s oppression. In the wake of WWI, European dadaists criticized the value of the bourgeoisie with jarring and raw pieces of art that were the antithesis of the soft and harmonious paintings that belonged to the previous era. In the modern day, street artists like Shepard Fairey and Banksy oppose \u2018the system\u2019 with subversive graffiti. I have no doubt that artists will continue to fight the wrongs they perceive in this world with creative expression, just as they always have. Score: 0 Of course art is an act of resistance. The point of art, whether it be music, books, fashion, or artwork(paintings/drawings), is to display the way one feels, or their beliefs, in an outside of the box manner. A lot of times in english class we are required to find the theme or message of a specific text or image, and that is because everything has one. Recently, I have begun to read books that are about the African-American society, police brutality, and racism (). The books themselves have such significant meanings about the racism in the US and the injustice of the system (which I won't go into detail about right now). Books are just one small example, but the point I'm trying to get across is that all art has an underlying meaning, whether it be beauty, resistance, unfairness, or injustice, and therefore, art can be a form of protest. Art is built upon resistance. Throughout every culture that has ever existed on this earth art has been used by so many to completely express themselves. I personally think the greatest art comes from those resisting. Those in a dire time of need have the most to express. They can completely fill their art with the purest emotion possible. I am a very strong believer that art is an amazing way to vent and allow your audience to almost empathize with whatever it is you're going through. I don\u2019t completely see art as a luxury. The way I see it, luxury is merely a byproduct of the message you're sending within your art. An example of resistance in our nation's past can be shown through many of the famous poet Langston Hughes\u2019 poems. Hughes wrote from the perspective of a black man in a nation against him and the raw emotion displayed in his poetry puts you there. Hughes alone shows how beneficial resistance can be within art. Personally I do believe that art can be a viable form of resistance or protest. Artist are able to convey different thoughts or emotions through their wok in a way that cannot be completely expressed through words alone. With this, the same sorts of feelings can be provoked from those who feel similarly and can eventually lead to a united group that is capable of working for change. Through different means of expressing an opinion, using art has continuously helped spark people\u2019s motivation. Art has been used to introduce new perspectives throughout history and can be just effective today. It is true that many people may not view art as anything with meaning, but rather just a luxury. Some tend to view art as an unsuitable approach when pushing for societal change, let alone an effective option at all. Having people physically protest for a cause can be incredibly successfully if handled correctly. Having a physical presence in the situation at hand alone can create a considerably powerful message. While these points are justifiable, it is not to say that art in unable to contribute to these various approaches in a different way. With such a wide group of people art can be exposed to, countless ideas can be shaped by viewers of all backgrounds. I think that art can definitely be an act of resistance. Many works of art share a message that holds some form of resistance such as hidden messages about problems that our world today is facing, or things that are happening today in the world that people feel strongly about. This can help influence someone on their feelings towards an important message that has been created within the artwork. Today throughout social media, I see many artworks that are sharing the artists depiction on issues that we are facing around the world today. For example, I see a lot of artworks emerging around social media regarding the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement. I have seen quite a few artworks that pertain a message regarding police brutality. I have also seen many artworks around social media regarding the \u201cTimes Up\u201d movement. I believe that these works of art highly depict social and cultural messages that need to be changed or resolved. I believe that art can be an act of resistance. Art can be created in an abundance of forms and is given to everyone to access, no matter who you are or what your background. By creating art, it gives the creator as well as others the ability to emote and show opinion through these images. I believe in this ideal because of how widespread art is and how many forms that it may take. Hence why societal transformation can be focused on protests, politics, business and art as a whole. Liberty leading the people, the murals painted on the Berlin wall, and the women\u2019s march logo. All these images are more than just murals and paintings. Art unites people under a common image. One painting or one image can be the face of a revolution or what the movement is remembered by. For example the \u201cEveryone is welcome here\u201d which can be seen around America in storefront windows in other places. It is what is spread and seen by people. Or look at Liberty leading the people the image we all associate with the French Revolution. Art gives one unforgettable image for a moment to be remembered by. Watching history throughout the years it is clear that art mirrors the way people feel. Take the dada art movement for example. People were disillusioned after WWII and it was the new types of art that showed that. Art is people\u2019s true feelings and anger used productively to make something creative and inspirational. I understand the importance of protests and politics, but we first need art to initially spark the revolution. Protests means nothing if no one is there. People need to see how people are feeling first. People need to see why change is needed first. People need to see why people want change first. People need to see art and murals first. Art can unite and build support. Art shows how people feel. Art is not just paint on wall and canvases. Art is what begins the revolution. As a student artist, naturally, I was drawn to this topic. As someone who believes that you should work to see a change, naturally, I was drawn away from this topic. Nothing's going to change if we just sit around making art that expresses our unease with our situations. I can draw as many political works as I want, nothing is going to change my situation unless I try to improve it for myself. While yes, maybe your art can help shift the mind of someone who is already slightly partial to your views and ideals, your art isn't going to save the world or have as big of an impact as you think unless you have influence. In supplement with actions that better your life, socially and culturally, yeah, art can be great. However, if making pretty pictures and clothing is all you're doing in the hopes of a societal reform , I'm afraid we're not living on the same planet. I say yes, do continue to create art maybe for the comfort of others who find solace in your work, but know that it's rather optimistic to think that the change you want lies within the creative works of yourself or others. While popular works of art can serve as a catalyst for change, these ideas can only go so far without being carried to fruition by active people willing to make a change (the right way). Score: 1 In a historical context, it is safe to say that art has the ability to inspire and provoke change within a society. Whether that change is good or bad, however, depends upon the influence of the artist. For example, Karl Marx\u2019s famous book The Communist Manifesto is widely recognized as the catalyst of communism. This is an example of an instance when an attempt of societal transformation through art has gone in dark directions, as it has led to nations starving and people dying. Especially today, it\u2019s important for an artist to use his influence in order to aid society, not the contrary. This is exactly the revelation that Kendrick Lamar conveys in his album To Pimp a Butterfly. He raps about the importance of using one\u2019s influence for the good of the community, not for a personal agenda. This is such an important message for all the artists in the world, especially this day in age. Because art does spark resistance and provoke change, and these can be very positive things. Score: 2 Art is expression. Expression is a tool that humanity takes as a tool to express the mind, body and soul. And in this tool, history has proven powerful of which examples such as grief, happiness and resistance can be expressed. Namely, a growth in awareness of social justices in recent years of the inequality of gender- job salaries and treatment are prime examples. A specific expression of resistance to the gender inequality would be the negative publicity the Grammy\u2019s have recently been the subject only one woman was awarded for her career achievements. News broadcasts, articles, fashion have all been effective in bringing about awareness for the social injustices women (and men) are victims to. Social and cultural change does not happen overnight, however awareness can be described as the beginnings of a social revolution. Although many may see different forms of art as simply entertainment, the only reasoning art exists and is made is for a spectacle to the public, art does not have one reasoning for its existence. Artists of many forms strive to expression of emotion, of truth, of life and even have specific reasons for their art, their ulterior motive. Therefore, art cannot simply be to entertain but, to expressions of the artist or the artists attempt to gain public awareness of their art and their cause and purpose. Art is an expression that can be a form of resistance, thorugh out history in innumerable ways. Score: 1 Art can be an act of resistance. Throughout history, ordinary people have turned to art for political expression and social defiance of standards in their government, nation, and/or society. One notable movement that required art was the Civil Rights Movement, which sparked in the 1960s. While direct involvement in protests and lawsuits moved forward the goal of racial equality for black citizens, art captured the deep and complex themes and emotions associated with the oppressed minority. Viewers could empathize with the subjects in paintings and murals, which demonstrate pain and distress. For example, Norman Rockwell's 1964 painting Rockwell & Race depicts violence against civil rights workers, an unfair issue in America that requires social change. Of course, artwork during the Civil Rights Movement was not always dark. Portraits of Martin Luther King Jr. could also be considered an act of resistance, as struggling minorities would continue to support him and his legacy despite of backlash from the federal government and the majority of Americans. Ordinary people enjoy and relate to art, which is why it remains a powerful weapon of resistance against certain political and social conditions. I do think that art can be an effective method of resistance--and I believe so because art has been one of the most profound factors in shaping society as we know it. Any major change in history came with a change in the arts. For example, the Renaissance cam with rebirth of culture--and art is what led us out of the \u201cdarkness\u201d of the Middle Ages into the intellectual sophistication of the Renaissance. Art belongs to the people; it always has. We saw that with the birth of hip-hop as a form resistance to an unjust government. In the history of humans, there has always been art as a constant. It has shaped any major event that has happened--political cartoons, a form of art, has managed to overwhelmingly affect the course of wars and politics. Art has always been about the people, and it can be a very effective method to bring about change and resistance. Art is what makes \u201cpolitical\u201d things or heavy subjects that aren\u2019t really talked about, a major topic in popular culture. Art is what makes us human, and in cases like the Holocaust where the government tried to entirely erase a group\u2019s humanity, the simple existence of art can be a form of resistance. Art can also resist through representation--representing the oppressed, the ones silenced, the ones that don\u2019t have a voice. Art gives a voice to the people, and it can and should be used as a form of resistance to oppression and injustice. Art can absolutely be a form of resistance. I that that one of the most common forms of resistance is art; whether it be a painting, a poem, or a song, many artists use their talents to speak out against ideas or events that they do not agree with. I believe that is is extremely important for influential artists to do. If they have a large fan base, they should take advantage of that and create a piece of art that speaks volumes for what they believe is right. I think that it is also a very effective way of resistance because it easily spreads throughout a larger population. If a person hears a song on the radio that promotes racial equality, they are more likely to resonate and remember that song rather than a political debate or protest. Logic, who is a popular rap artist in today\u2019s industry, wrote an album entitled \u201cEverybody\u201d that a great example of this. In the songs in his album, he promotes equality for \u201cevery race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\u201d. He used his fan base to spread his messages of equality. Many artists like Logic use their popularity to their advantage to create a form of resistance. Although some may say that art is a luxury now a days, with all the bad that is going on in the world, I think that art is a way that we can make a change. When we feel like we are losing our voices, art can speak for us, and make the public the change that we want to see. Although people are going through struggles with status, this should spark an effort in the art community, where people can make public and put on record their opinions. By writing stories on current day politics and how they have been effected, they are publicizing the voice of other people, who may have lost their own voices. Paintings can show what is going on in the world better than words can explain, by showing the audience the pain, and have them experience and see what the artist sees. Art is a beautiful way to voice opinions, and show the audience the wrong that is going on. Art can spark a revolution that can bring a change, and can show the audience what is going on, and what needs to be done. Art is a beautiful way to voice opinion. When times are hard, it is easy to shut down and say art is now a luxury because there are more important things going on, but I believe art can bring that change. In the past, many people have voiced their opinions on war through songs, and explaining how their needs to be peace. Celebrities wore Me Too buttons on their shirts at an award ceremony to stand with sexual assault victims. Art is a way that can help bring change. Score: 2 Art is the most sincere form of expression a person can achieve. While it has a wide range of style and influences, purposes and impacts, but fundamentally, art is whatever we make it to be - both as creators and consumers. Dance is known for its emotive displays, a physical outburst at communicate what words can not. Literature captivates and transforms its audience, engulfing them in a world that only a dancer would be able to feel. Music speaks from the soul, the heart, the brain. Sculpture, painting, illustration, animation - they all tie down beauty and horror and everything that makes of this world and beyond. Art is many things, from grand paintings displayed at the Louvre or the Acropolis to street musicians and the clothes visionaries sew. Anything a person can hope to express can be expressed through art - so why not resistance? Throughout the ages, protest and revolution have propelled humanity forward with art running not parallel, but entwined with the changes. Sure, the most dire of circumstances may cause some to pause and ask if art ought to be a priority, but the fact is that art is so fundamental to understanding human nature that is doesn\u2019t detract from revolution, it doesn\u2019t detract from resistance - art enhances it. Score: 1 Yes, I think art can be an act of resistance. The wide umbrella of art includes literature, cinema, painting, drawing, photography, etc. Art can be quite an effective form of protest, using creative expression as a weapon in the fields of politics, allowing certain groups to further their agendas through popular art. For example, literature has seen many significant acts of resistance throughout history, including the pamphlet Common Sense written by Thomas Paine in January 1776. Paine\u2019s pamphlet was written as an act of resistance towards King George III and Parliament, imploring American colonists to fight for their independence from the tyrannical rule of Great Britain. Paine\u2019s pamphlet became a phenomenon and was widely credited with convincing many colonists that independence was necessary, leading to the American Revolution which shaped the country and global superpower we live in today. While I can understand why some may argue that art is just a luxury, and insist that art cannot invoke major changes in our world, Paine\u2019s pamphlet perfectly exemplifies the power art contains, and how art can most definitely be an successful act of resistance. Murals I believe that art can in fact be a form of resistance. The definition of resistance is the refusal to accept or comply with something. Resistance in society can be seen through many different ways such as protests, speeches, riots, music, and art. Although resistance is most successful through politics, protests, and motivational speeches, resistance can also be enabled through different forms of art. Art generates different emotional responses from people, and if the art reflects the people\u2019s common dissatisfaction with society, than it can certainly be a form of resistance. Throughout history the main and most effective forms of resistance have been through physical protest and resistance to government, but there is always an underlying aspect of art and literature that helps to drive such resistance movements. An example of this is the colonists during the American Revolution. Yes, there main forms of resistance were through battle, boycott, and protest, but in the background there was specific types of propaganda and art that helped to fuel the fire of the American Revolution. The art conveyed the colonists feelings of refusal to accept or comply with the British tyrannic rule."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

For instance, let's take Ivanka Trump she is given the label by society Trump's Daughter and know people don't want to buy from her line. When she has not involved with what decisions her father makes and since people have so much hatred on Trump are also taking charge on on his kids to which is unfair. When marketing should be based off of what is trendy not politcally. I speak for myself when I say that politics don't affect me when i go shopping. Personally, I just focus on what I like and not the politic views. If a store is selling products, I don't like I will simply just ignore it and move on. Yet on the other hand, if a store is advertising then I will boycott but not make others boycott the store. Some stores don't advertising simply sell products and those stores are fine as long as they aren't pressing me into buying products that go against my wishes. Many people are also freaking out just for selling and jumping on conclusions. They think that if a stores sells products that they are automatically on that side, which could be completely wrong.

While the never-ending words you are racist about people who talk about politics, watch politics, and even post things about politics this is something different, people consider the trumps so racist but politics do not affect the way i shop because its simply clothing and nothing else. The store in my opinion should not have removed her clothing line while nobody else says says bad things about this but only talk bout the bad things that happen to the trumps. Ivanka herself has not done any harm to have her clothing removed just because she if a trump. it is racist to the trumps to remove her clothing when she hasn't done anything wrong but people think that shes has because she is a trump so she automatically gets considered a racist when she isnt.

As long as Westbrook can keep up and they've got Taj Gibson as well, they would probably go to seven games. A Washington-Cleveland eastern conference finals is what everyone should really be looking forward to. The best game of the regular season was played between those two teams, Cleveland had the better record, but against each other they are evenly matched. What about the Knicks ? Have to question some of your picks. First, wizards will NOT sweep the hawks. that one is probably going seven, as will bucks-raptors and clips-jazz. Celtics will NOT have an easy time with bulls--as flawed as they are, Chicago has more individual talent, which is Boston's Achilles heel in a playoff series. finally, spurs will beat the grizzlies in 4 or 5--no way that one is going 7. Warriors will win and Cavs won't even last long in the playoffs. Score: 3.0 Some serious bias.

Score: 1.0 I'll refrain (almost) from commenting on the ridiculousness of the Raptors/Bucks prediction since I live in T.O. and my views on that series (Raps in five) are no doubt biased by homerism. What really struck me was saying that Memphis will take San Antonio to seven but Russell can't squeeze out even one game vs the Rockets... that seems to defy logic. Lowry looked pretty healthy and ready to play in his four games back. I'd think that would give the Raptors a decisive edge. Score: 3.0 Ujiri is an outstanding GM who stole both Tucker and Ibaka at the trade deadline. The Raps became a much more likely Eastern finalist as a result. The acquired talent made them tougher, and better defensively. Lowry's injury was a second half problem, but the team still went 14-7 without him. They relied on DeRozan to score heavily, but also had other secondary players step up. Antetokounmpo is a wonderful athlete to watch, but he doesn't know how to take over games and finish them in the fourth quarter like Lowry does. The Raps are a much deeper team now and will show it in this playoff series. Raps in five or possibly six. The Raps match up well against the Celtics, and they could surprise in the East. The question is, of course, has James and this group around him finally reached the end of their / his run. The answer is a definite maybe. Score: 5.0 probably 5 or 6 Utah will probably beat the Clippers but this one is the hardest to pick ... but the Rockets in 4 ??? that is ridiculous. Houston is 26th in defense and is the worst of all at defending points in the paint. Oklahoma has two very capable centers and they use them well. The Thunder barely lost to Golden State last year and the team is better and healthier this year. This will be a great series but I think Oklahoma will prevail and end up facing Golden State again Toronto Vs Milwaukee is rough to pick but I think the Raptors may eek it out. But the Hawks vs the Wizards ... the Hawks will win this series in five games, esp if Howard decides to really play. In fact I think the Hawks are the only team that can seriously challenge the Cavs because of match ups. In the end we are most likely looking at Golden State Vs Cleveland again, which will be a monster of a series.

The way Carr\u00e8re talks about his inability to be at peace with himself, to find happiness is both heart wrenching and funny. Later, he is taught about love and altruism by the very people he chooses to write about and his characters stay with you for ever. I so admire how he can take you into people's lives and talk to you about them with such respect, admiration and tenderness in part because their ability to live, to work, to love is foreign to him. I have given away this gem of a book many many times, very much like I gave away Joan Didion's The Year of magical thinking Enjoy! you are in for a real treat. Score: 3 Indeed the writer was captured by Carrere into making him one of the best French writers of nonfiction. My opinion is based on the reading of The Kingdom, which I found to be one of the most artificial and arrogant books I have read. He makes himself the hero of the story by putting himself at the same of Christ, Saint Paul and Saint Luke and spending more than half of the book on himself, describing absolutely irrelevant aspects of his life, like the search for a nanny in Paris and the writing of his (obscure) book on Phillip K. Dick. He did very little research on the birth of Christianity, basing most of his opinions on a relatively unknown, salacious, book on Christianity written 19th century. He is so arrogant as to tell us what was Saint Luke thinking and why the Magnificat is an invention and so offensive as to claim that the Virgin Mary masturbated herself. How does he know? Any evidence, even indirect? His evidence seems to come from his admitted love of masturbating while watching pornographic movies. It is not that he reinvented nonfiction.....\u201d, blends personal history, reportage, philosophy and theology as the author says, but that he produces a hodge-podge of anything that comes to his mind. It is an insult to the reader\u2019s intelligence. I doubt that the author of the article read Carrere\u2019s books. If you can read Spanish or Italian, see my extensive review of El Reino in Amazon.com and Il Regno in Amazon.it Score: 17 I wish that the article talked a bit about the stylistic choices the translator made when translating Emmanuel Carrere\u2019s books into English. The article picked my interest, and I checked The Kingdom (amazon) and Le Royaume (amazon.fr) pages to decide which language I should choose to read him. I used look inside option and happened to compare the first paragraph on the page Prologue (Paris, 2011) which was available on both languages, and I was surprised by the choices the translator made.  became \u201cWhat would happen if this impossible event really did take place?\u201d I would have instead translated it: if we assume this impossible event takes place for good, what would happen then?\u201d \u201cquelles paroles prononceriez-vous\u201d became \u201cwhat would you say\u201d instead of \u201cWhich words would you utter?\u201d Just based on this paragraph alone, if I am not mistaken, it seems that during the translation some nuances were lost. Score: 8 It looks like you are not a professional translator and by definition, a translation loses part of the original text. Score: 1 The funny thing is, if literary translation were based simply on word-to-word correspondence without regard to context or voice or register (as the commenter assumes), then even Google Translate does a better job (and more idiomatic, to boot!) than both the translator and the commenter. Suppose this impossible thing happens for good, what would happen? What words would you pronounce?  Don't feel so bad, amateur translators, the NYT recently wrote an article on the millions of dollars and the armies of PhDs and programmers that Google devotes to creating the artificial intelligence behind Google Translate. No doubt, one day, AI will be able to read an entire work and determine the appropriate voice and character for every sentence that it translates, but for now, we still need professional literary translators to appreciate the unique voice of a writer. From the comments on motorcycle trips, visits to art museums -- and the peculiar comment on lovely portraits by Rembrandt -- compelling might be better -- this does pose a good question as to why do we want to see Rembrandt's portraits?? but I do not long to read any books by this author. I will take my history stirred gently --not shaken. Score: 5 I've been reading him for years, clearly one of the best current novelists/writers. There aren't many around in France.

Score: 2 I agree also - in fact I just finished Roman Russe (my Life as a Russian Novel), having read several other of his works over the years in the original French. A very compelling first person voice - reflective, sometimes quite funny - and yes flawed - in essence very human. Score: 1 I was surprised by the omission of any reference to Carr\u00e8re\u2019s A Journey into the Mind of Philip K. Dick. Score: 11 The New York Times Magazine, including its contributing writer Wyatt Mason, consistently publishes admiring profiles of the prominent writers whose work I most dislike. Carr\u00e8re is one of them. His work isn't so much sincere as it is an affectation of sincerity, and in this the Confessions it most closely recalls are Rousseau's. For the rest, it's not just that what Carr\u00e8re does sounds narcissistic, as even Mason acknowledges, but that it *is* narcissistic, and profoundly so, which even a cursory viewing of Retour \u00e0 Kotelnitsch, the documentary mentioned in this profile, will make fully clear to anyone with a measure of discernment. I sometimes wish I weren't so thoroughly out of step with the literary tastemakers in NYC, but by promoting writers like Carr\u00e8re they make it awfully hard to share their enthusiasm. Score: 7 One can't help but think that Carr\u00e8re's spiritual and psychological crisis that became his bestseller The Kingdom was, if not invented, then prolonged, by the author in order to write a good book. It is the national sport of France to have these struggles with Catholicism and then to write about it; Carr\u00e8re situates himself in this tradition of spiritual and existential doubt that goes back to, oh let''s say, Descartes, becoming I publish therefore I am.  But what betrays the intellectual and spiritual limits of these struggles is how they are all confined to a tempest in the teapot of Christianity. When Americans have spiritual crises, we convert to Islam or go to India or follow Zen. When the French have these spiritual crises, they always go back home, to the comforts of the Catholicism of the class to which they were born. I say comforts because Catholicism provides a ready-made body of scholarship in French and in Latin and in Greek that someone of Carr\u00e8re's typical social and educational background could easily delve into for source material to write about. I would be more convinced of Carr\u00e8re's spiritual crisis if it had propelled him to learn Sanskrit or Arabic or Chinese and delved into these what would be for him totally foreign bodies of sources in order to confront the issues of god and truth and being. Score: 9 For the past two years, after stumbling upon his Paris Review interview, I devoured Carrere's nonfiction books (including the Philip K. Dick one that many watchers of Amazon's High Castle might enjoy). I don't know how to describe what makes his work so compelling, but I have not been this excited by an author as an adult. I have given away my copies of his books only to want to buy them again when the urge arises to reread them. The honestness with which he describes life, his own struggles as a person and an artist, and the level of craft and art in his books\u2014I only wish I could read them in French! Score: 5 This recommendation could not be more timely. I recently read The Adversary, and just started his Life as a Russian Novel. I have to say I have never read Carr\u00e8re but I am keen now to search him out. The line about rubbing the cherry table with oil, that it glows with inner light is lovely. Will I be the only reader who views the scene about the motor scooter as one in which the writer seeks to replicate Carr\u00e8re's method of bringing himself into the story? Score: 1 Thanks for bringing Emmanuel Carrere to the attention of your readers. L'adversaire is one of my favorite works of non-fiction; it takes the French specialty of the fait divers to sinister perfection. Sometimes Carrere writes dismissively, in a casual, offhand way, about middle-aged women; and I look forward to discovering his handling of the English woman who loses her companion in the tsunami. Score: 3 People and individuals are being drowned in words by writers compelled to write. If writings and reading do not make others realize insufficiency of words in conveying the deeper truth, then such writings and writers have failed. The detritus of such failure is being left on the shores of the western societies everywhere\u2026.

Karen, one of the nurses, helped me many times with specific problems --- If I can teach a 4-year-old how to do this I can teach you! Yes, ostomy nurses crowd the angelic throngs is a true statement. Regardless of the support and help, a new ostomy requires a huge adjustment. It looks nasty, it smells different (my 11-year old daughter's complaints would attest to this), and no one likes to wake up and change their bedding in the middle of the night because a bag came loose. I didn't know how many people had ostomies until I got one, but I know well the challenges that go along with it. Speaking openly about that experience and reducing the stigma of having an ostomy is really important, as well as knowing that support and help is available.

I had gone through many surgeries (kidney problems covered everything) but the doctors couldn't come up with a permanent fix, so the urostomy was the result.

This is why it is so important that after initial ostomy surgery people don't accept/settle for substandard care or negative quality of life aspects that can be changed.

A clean pouch filled with chocolate pudding and pictures of what it looked like on my body were all I needed to prove my point. Just as physicians need to be more mindful of the financial cost of their take-two-and-call-me-in-the-morning treatments, they also need to appreciate the psychic cost of the medical devices they prescribe.

So not only do I take care of ostomy patients every day but I also live with one each and every day. And I can unequivocally say that there's nothing that someone can't do because they have an ostomy. In fact having an ostomy for some people is the best thing that's ever happened to them. Not only can it be life-saving, but it can actually gives them their life back , which is the case for me.

Sugar-damaged LDL can't deliver nutrients such as cholesterol, triglycerides, vitamins and antioxidants to brain cells. If you take statins, statins will lower the numbers of LDLs, and this will prevent brain cells from obtaining adequate supply of brain nutrients carried by LDLs, similar to diabetes patients. High number of LDL-P (particle), a cause of atherosclerosis, and high number of triglycerides are caused by excess level of carbs intake instead of high level of saturated fats intake.

He is no #tweeterinchief. Everyday he is making progress towards making China's enormous bureaucratic government a #finelytunedmachine. Trump was able to short-circuit the Republican Party apparatus which ought to be a filter for character, competence and policy by mastering free media and seducing large swaths of the Republican coalition.

The chinese model is nothing new. The first authoritarian capitalism was spearheaded by singapore, taiwan, and by south korea. Singapore stuck to the authoritarian system and is still prospering. South korea and taiwan gave up authoritarianism midway and are heavily paying the price. Though i worry about the current chinese politics. The maoist fanatics are trying to use xi jinping to return to power, still Xi is much better than Bo Xilai. Dont even wanna imagine Bo being in power. But yeah - the Chinese should stay far from Mao. His policies were a disaster. But then again you could say if not for his disaster - there would not have been reforms. On another note - What the Chinese leadership needs to do to ensure stability in the populous is to have a more transparent court/justice system. As to South Korea and Taiwan paying the price - how much of that do you think is simply mainland China waking up and being more competitive? I mean South Korea exports a whole lot to China - and Taiwans companies have much of their production on mainland China.. Ever since the authoritarian government in korea resigned the economy began to decline. During the military rule korean economy was booming via manufacturing and savings, the labor unions were violently suppressed and virtually everyone was employed. When the military government disappeared the labor unions began to rule supreme and the new democratic government changed the korean economy into a service economy based on cheap money and reckless spending, factories and companies left korea in droves to china and so many people lost their jobs. Korea imports almost everything from china, from basic necessities to luxury items, and the real unemployment rate for korean youth is staggering 34%. Sure, korea does export things to china, like K-pop and plastic surgeries, but thats pretty much it. The famous smartphones from samsung and LG may be designed by koreans, but the phone's actual manufacture is done in china. As for taiwan the taiwanese are much poorer than the average korean so I don't even need to explain how bad things are over there. Score: 0 East Asian countries like China or Japan with tradition of Confucianism has established strong state with flexible and powerful executive office to govern country with the concept of 'rule by law' instead of 'rule of law' because there is no tradition to develop 'rule of law' that can apply to anybody including the top of the country or the party leader. The sophistication and the authoritative power of the state is far superior to that of the western countries. The example is Japan's handling of the so-called peace constitution. Japan has established military called 'Self-Defense Force', and prime minister Abe has made legal to use it in anywhere in the world including South China Sea. There is no constitutional check in real sense to veto the executive power or parliamentary legislations. Japan's supreme court has sided with the executive power in the past as far as security is concerned. China does not need such cumbersome maneuver because her sovereign is the Chinese Communist Party, not the Chinese people. Therefore the west with 'rule of law' can't imitate China. It looks like President Trump prefers 'rule by law' though he utters occasionally 'rule of law' withoutreally understanding it. Score: 1 With America turning reactionary and illiberal, the Chinese may have their long foretold moment in spite of themselves. Score: 0 Wonderfully accurate and balanced appraisal. Score: 2 I do think that some of the positive aspects to China's central government is often overlooked. No government is perfect, China's certainly has its own set of issues. but that is the same with the U.S., the E.U., everywhere. The good aspect of having such concentrated power is that you can get things done quickly--a very good thing if your leader is someone you agree with. If China decided that it wants to decrease its greenhouse emissions and have all cars be electric by, say, 2030, there's a good chance that it'll happen. The U.S., on the other hand, sees change very slowly because of our separation of power (again, a good thing overall There's always going to be pros and cons to different styles of government, but we should recognize the pros when they exist. Score: 3 Though just a few questions with very vague and concise answers in return, I can definitely tell this professor has really been studying China's economic miracle and political landscape. He gave credits to the government, outlined merits of centralized structure without bias, but most importantly, he kept cool-headed when comparing west and east models, ended up warning against fervent embrace for authoritarianism as much greater potential for instability down the road. Score: 7 Interesting, valuable interview, though Dr. Heilmann seems, like most of us, to view Chinese governance through a Western lens which leads, naturally, to Western conclusions and predictions. Since NONE of the Western predictions about China's development has EVER been borne out in reality we must question this approach and seek other intellectual schemas with more predictive value. Because China isn't run on Communist Party lines, either. China is governed as it has been governed for the past 1,800 years: on a Confucian\u2013which is to say, moral\u2013basis, by the smartest, most honest, most experienced people it can find. So statements like, The Communist Party has expanded and mobilized a parallel disciplinary bureaucracy with great powers to step in and investigate. But it has no clearly defined legal basis disregard the right of the Chinese government to act as morality demands. They tried our system of legalism for 400 years and found that it produces squabbles, lawsuits and overflowing prisons (does this sound familiar?), so they've stuck with morality-based government ever since. It seems to be working as well today as ever. Score: 4 This piece shows some open-mindedness on the part of Mr. Heilmann and NYT journalist Mr. Johnson. Still, it seems that it's so hard for you to get an answer for China's success.

Animals have always been a huge part of my life, each one different and with its own idiosyncrasies. I adopted a young rescue dog once who had been badly abused. He joined a rambunctious bunch of dogs who were frequently getting up to all sorts of antics. I learnt very quickly that I must never raise my voice at any of the other dogs, even when destruction of something precious seemed imminent. My Australian cattle dog hated it when I spoke to someone on the phone and he'd learnt that if he grabbed a book off the bookshelf and started to rip it up this would catapult me off any phone call pronto. if I yelled Warrigal, drop that! my rescue dog Mondo (who never ever did anything that might risk the slightest reprimand) would fling himself down on the floor and lie there shaking and wimpering in fear. It was awful. I learnt I had to keep my voice down and every even. For the first few years poor Mondo - who grew into a giant dog - had terrible nightmares. He would start screaming in his sleep. But gradually he grew in confidence, his nightmares stopped, and he lived a very long life for a giant dog, dying in his 14th year. While I partly take credit for bringing him out of his shell, most of the credit has to go to a young border collie cross who took Mondo under her care. It was so funny to see Plinki pin Mondo's giant head under her small paw, insisting that he submit, while she washed him. I had to stop as soon as I read the word abused.  I don't want to rain on the parade, but I am so angry when I hear that a donkey, or any animal, has been abused. I want to kill the person that abuses an animal. I know this sounds extreme, but I am being honest. I have heard enough of mankind inhumanity to animals. I have had contact with a number of donkeys at the farm of friends of our in Ireland. I have found them to be interesting and intelligent and appreciative of an apple or a carrot. The thought that anyone could/would abuse one of the beautiful animals really sends me around the bend.

Second, dentists are not trained (in my state nor are we licensed) to practice medicine and we could create as much harm as good. The safest bet for dentists is to watch and monitor oral health. If all else is stable and in balance in a patient's life and at the same time there appears a marked increase in gum disease or decay that is 'out of the norm', that is an indicator something is wrong with the body, i.e. possible diabetes.

People who go to the dentist are usually educated and proactive types; giving them more info could only help. Score: 20 A dentist isn't qualified to diagnose or treat diabetes, and having dentists provide a spot glucose check every time they see gum disease is the wrong approach. A spot blood glucose reading won't diagnose diabetes unless it is over 200. Someone could easily have diabetes and have a normal blood glucose reading at that moment. Diabetes screening should be performed by a medical provider who is qualified to interpret the result and provide treatment if necessary. The way to diagnose diabetes is with an A1C test not with a spot blood glucose check via a finger stick. If you let dentists do these spot glucose tests then I'm sure people who might in fact have diabetes might think their dentist told them they don't have diabetes so now they don't need to worry about it. Since the finger stick test is not conclusive what's the point? If an eye doctor finds signs of retinopathy during an exam, they will tell the patient to see a doctor and get screened for diabetes - they won't try to give a blood test and diagnose diabetes! Let dentists simply educate patients that gum disease might occur with diabetes, and if they have never been screened then they should be screened by an appropriate medical provider.

Indians knew this for thousands of years. \u201cJust do those things that are really natural and easy says Garbha sanskar from 1500-500 BC, in the Mahabharata around 400 BC and in traditional ayurvedic medicine as a guide in prenatal education Garbh means fetus in the womb and Sanskar means educating the mind. So, Garbh sanskar essentially means educating the mind of the fetus. It is traditionally believed that a child's mental and behavioural development starts as soon as it is conceived, personality begins to take shape in the womb, influenced by the mother's state of mind during pregnancy. This knowledge can be traced back to ancient scriptures and is included in the Ayurveda. One of the most famous tale is that of Abhimanyu from the Mahabharata. When Arjuna's wife was pregnant with their son Abhimanyu, he told her about war strategy. Abhimanyu was able to employ that during the battle of Kurukshetra. Garbha sanskar say it may be worth talking to your baby, listening to music and reading educative books while you are pregnant. This shall make baby more alert and bond with parents better. Mother\u2019s bond with the child starts right from the time of conception. The mother can shape up baby\u2019s first impressions. The positive thinking and attitude promotes physical well being of mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and after. The advantages of Garbh sanskar are not only that you educate your child but there is development of a bond between the mother and the child. I think this ties into children of depressed mothers having spoken language difficulties. Infants of depressed mothers are spoken to less and may have language delays says research I've read.

So if the mother teaches the baby sign language from birth (and since it has grammatical structure and the rest of the linguistic qualities of any language), then the child's general verbal ability should not suffer. But I imagine s/he will need sufficient input from speaking caregivers in order to learn speaking languages in particular. Score: 0 Many deaf education programs are primaryly oral programs.

Daily social and emotional reinforcement encourages children and adults to use a prevalent language. Children have an overwhelming desire to fit into the society they find themselves immersed in. Although their womb-learned language initially and permanently forms their oral skill level and comfort in one language, subsequent early exposure and development of a 2nd language becomes dominant. leading me in conversation to leap to the Spanish word before the English word occurs to me. To further what Wordsmith said, I want to point out how easy it is to lose a language even after it's been dominant for your entire childhood, not just in the womb. I was born to monolingual parents in a monolingual country and raised there for 19 years. At 13 though, I went to an English-immersion school there, and immediately after, I went to college in the US and have been living here ever since (I'm in my 30s now). My husband and friends are American. I didn't keep up with my mother tongue except to speak to my family by phone once a week. To my great surprise, I started losing my first language so quickly that I became unable to hold a basic conversation without pausing to look for words, often going as far as needing a dictionary! Not only had English become my primary language, but I had lost much of what I previously had of my first language (English became my dominant as early as the end of said immersion school!) I had to start reading books and talking to people in my first language, and make a concerted effort to bring it back and keep it alive. I know elderly people who were in this situation but did not keep up their first language, and forgot it entirely. With that in mind, a few months in utero is nothing compared to your everyday exposure from there on. I'd say that your in-utero language matters inasmuch as it will make it easier for you to learn it later, if you so chose. But it does by no means magically make it your strongest if you don't use it enough. Score: 7 Children absorb and learn effortlessly even without direct instruction. In plenty of societies nobody addresses very young children but they too learn to be fully functioning adults. We don't have to talk to babies all the time. Anthropologists have shown how many ways there are to socialize children into and through language, and talking face to face with infants is rarely found across the globe.

Score: 25 The major difference is that in these societies where babies are not directly spoken to, there are large communities of adults speaking with and to each other constantly for the baby to observe and learn from. In our current society, it is not uncommon for a baby to not have any other adult around than the parent, and if they don't talk much to the baby (or other children), there's not a whole lot of language the baby is going to learn. This is why the exhortation is given to talk to your baby- with the presumption that otherwise the home might be relatively silent place.

I think the show (and intentionally so) will be a haphazard wayward path forward as he manages successfully to overcome trials while not being in control of how his victories entirely happened.

It struck me while listening to the coffee maker's tale that they were saying, that's what this is, it's a fable. It didn't really happen, just like the woman didn't turn into a crane and fly off, but the fable is meant to be unreal, recognizable, and an allegory for real life lessons or experiences. So I think this is a fable about dealing with the horrors of modern life. Fear mostly, of the government, mental health treatment, intimacy, one's own anger. This is explicitly stated at the end, this is a story about fear, and what comes next. I'm betting what comes next is anger. At some point they might play Peter Gabriel's Fear is the mother of violence. Also I think the X symbol, the Babadook, and many others, are fully intentional references, highlighting the cultural relativity. In the Angriest Boy, snicker-snack is in the last stanza, straight out of Jabberwocky, another fable. When Melanie got slammed by the book, her hand turned into, oddly, an exact copy of Chris Elliot's hand in Scary Movie 3.

Score: 1 This is a fantastic production, period. I saw Angela Lansbury and George Hearn in 1980, and this production holds its own against the original. What a cast! The limitations imposed by the space make this production's accomplishment all the more admirable. The reduction of James Lapine's orchestrations once more -- now down to a trio led by piano -- was really impressively done, and so well played. Score: 3 Saw Norm Lewis, Carolee Carmello, Brad Oscar, Jamie Jackson et al and the show was unforgettably wonderful. I have seen many productions, including the original, and this one is up there with the greats. Don't cheat yourself of an experience for the ages. Score: 4 Once again, Mr. Brantley fails theater goers with his tepid review. We saw this last night and were blown away by it. Loved Norm Lewis, Carolee Carmello and the cast. Score: 0 Just saw this last night with Norm Lewis as Sweeney. What a gift he is in the role! Score: 1 Saw it last might for the third time. What a spectacular complement to the original production (which I also saw, coincidentally, three times). No production I've seen in the intervening years has come close to translating the incredible drama and score so effectively. This version probably could not have succeeded as well 40 years ago - it's really a production for those who love Sweeney Todd revere the story and song, which is not to say it can't be enjoyed by a first-time viewer. But it presents the piece in a thrillingly theatrical way. AND - the integration of the incredible score is made more apparent by the wonderful reduced orchestration, which relies principally upon the piano - what a thrill to hear the drama played on that instrument so magnificently. I'm sorry the four British members of the cast have concluded their engagement. her voice is outstanding and she plays both the Bigger Woman and Perrilli with charm, grace and full comic turns intact. She is one to look for in the future ... loved all the performances including that Barber... but lets not forget about his wife This was my 7th production and I loved it. It's a lot of fun to see it in such a different and in-your-face way. The pie shop setting is amusing and when the play starts, nothing feels false at all. In this intimate room and with only 3 players in the band tucked into one corner, you hear every word (which was kind of a revelation given that I already know every word by heart). We already have tickets for later in the run to go back and see the great Norm Lewis after he takes over the role. And *definitely* get a pie - they are each pretty special. Score: 4 Can't agree with the moderate tone of this review. i thought this production was splendid. Score: 6 Don't Walk. This is a truly magical production. Score: 7 Brilliant intimate production in a recreated London pie shop with a talented cast and clever trio. Having the marvelous pies before the show started only increased anticipation. Such joy, such clear Sondheim, those musical numbers making such sense. This was the production I have always dreamed of and cannot wait to see it again. We saw this production today (Saturday matinee) No one was yelling, everyone is singing. The singing and acting are first rate. Tiny theater with about 130 seats provides for a very intimate and riveting experience. And yes - pre order the meat pies. They were great. Score: 6 One of my all-time favorites - seen it a few times - the film many times A turntable set with the barber shop and the ovens would perfect the production, space and funds clearly would not allow for that. Loved that the fourth wall was broken down, wonderful singing and truly gifted tiny orchestra. By all means Sondheim lovers, you need to see this imaginative Sweeney. Score: 7 Shakes head, eye roll. Score: 9 Wow what a strange and almost review. I saw it last night after last seeing the Lupone/Cervais production. I thought this was an amazing production. Ms Finke was fabulous, Mr Secomb owned the room with his eyes, the rest of the cast absolute perfection. It was simply put a marvelous evening in the theater. RUN to get tickets if you can. And by all mean get the pies they were sensational as baked by Bill Yossess ex White House Pastry chef. Score: 15 Don't put stock in Mr. Brantley's somewhat jaded review. Go see it for yourself. This production is innovative, intriguing, beguiling, heartbreaking, and entrancing in equal measure. The singers and musicians are incredible and when you leave the show you have no doubt about their great talent and commitment to making this an outstanding project. This production is guaranteed to capture your full attention, long after you leave the show. Score: 6 I thought Mrs. Lovett was fantastic, probably the best part of the production. Also the meat pies had tiny chicken in them so there was no visceral reaction to the irony - and they were incredible!

My husband and I along with another couple, were totally blown away by the Barrow Street production and would see it again in a heartbeat! I have to say I think you missed out on how pure and wonderful a show this production really is. Maybe you should go back, not as a reviewer but as a member of the audience, with a whole other set of eyes, ears, and open to another kind of experience. Score: 15 Could not disagree more with Mr. Brantley's (frankly jaded) assessment of this production. Unlike him, I haven't seen eight different productions, so maybe I don't have the expert's eye that he does. But I found plenty of nuance in this presentation - the scaled-down orchestra, the creative use of the limited space available to intensify the atmosphere, the willingness to reach out and make those in attendance more than just spectators. How can he not feel Ms. McCarthy's love for the character of Mrs. Lovett? This was one of the top theatrical experiences I've had in New York, all the way down to the (delicious) pies. Go see it, if you can get tickets, and take Mr. Brantley's sour, joyless assessment with a hefty helping of jellied eels. Score: 1 Probably better retitled The Demon Barber of Barrow Street, mai no? Score: 5 I saw the original Sweeney starring Angela Lansbury and was unimpressed. The audience gave her a standing ovation. The best Sweeney I've seen is the movie, Tim Burton's masterpiece with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. They bring out the pitch-black humor of the piece. He's obsessed with revenge. She's obsessed with him. The rest of the brilliant cast bring every character to brooding, bloody life. The degree of difficulty in making a musical about a serial killer could not be higher. They pull it off, my friends. Score: 2 Did the show design itself? No credits? Score: 9 After seeing many productions of Sweeney, including the original with Len Cariou and Bernadette Peters, think the Tooting Arts Club production is totally riveting. totally mad, not played safely. Ms. McCarthy's Mrs Lovett is played as a true loon; her performance of By the Sea revels in her madness. The confines of the theater make the play all the more intense and it is stunning. The set is pure Hogarth. The misery, the poverty, the sadness are there for the audience to see. One of the evening in the theater that will stay in my memory forever. Score: 6 Hard to believe that anyone who saw the original production would think Bernadette Peters played Mrs. Lovett. Angela Lansbury owned the part. Score: 2 Bernadette Peters as Mrs. Lovett? Maybe she ended up in a pie before she opened. If you're old enough to have seen it, you're entitled to a senior moment.

If climate change is real, then why does the USA need to be using millions of dollars to figure it out. The USA does not need to fund everything the world wants, that is the reason the US debt is so great. Let other countries spend their own money to figure it out, while we (the USA) focus on serious issues like the threat of nuclear war with North Korea, or illegal immigration.

But much of the population is against science, knowledge and education. In their minds, Obey Trumps Question. Score: 3.0 Regarding the objections of Robert S. Young to the March on Science, I disagree heartily. First, scientists are now and have always been caught up in the culture wars. Simply reviewing the history of science and scientists, I can't imagine how any thoughtful person could see it otherwise. Second, the wedge between scientists and a certain segment of the American electorate could not possibly have been made deeper by the March for Science. Consider the people who disdain you and your work, Mr. Young. Do you think the March on Science might really change their attitudes one way or the other? On the other hand, the March for Science and associated activism can help the nation as a whole better recognize that science matters to them - to their health, to their safety, to the storehouse of knowledge that their children and their children will inherit. Such activism also shines light on the fact that science and its benefits are under attack by the leaders of our current government. For my part, I briefly considered not traveling to Washington D.C. to march in the cold rain last Saturday, but then decided that doing so was a patriotic and moral duty. I marched. Score: 4.0 Linus Pauling is an example of a scientist who became an activist. In the early 1960s he lined up members of the National Academy of Sciences to sign a petition to ban atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. This effort preceded the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He and his wife actually marched in front of the White House with signs on a cold winter day. JFK and Jackie invited him in for dinner. Pauling got the Nobel Peace Prize for this work following his receipt of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in the early 1950s. I was thinking of Pauling when I went to the Mall last Saturday. In the 70s and 80s he advocated for better world-wide nutrition calling this issue the most important global issue. Following this advocacy, NIH started funding nutrition research. The Pauling Institute moved from Palo Alto to Oregon State University in the mid-1990s and thrives today as a legitimate leader in nutrition research. Score: 1.0 As the former (recently retired) Meteorologist in Charge at the National Weather Service office in St. Louis, I spoke at the post-march rally. My subject was the importance of critical thought, and how important it is that we, as scientists, embrace skepticism, answer the hard questions, and build trust. Here is a video of my talk, which begins about 15 minutes in. Score: 4.0 I cannot believe that the God who endowed us with such a mind intended for us not to use it.  I am a paleontologist at a highly visible institution, as well as an elder in a mainstream church. The two are not natural opposites, so enlightened people must acknowledge evolution as fact. The bitter dispute between rationalists and fundamentalists I think is politically stoked and a circular, infinite argument. I marched on Saturday. It was great, the feeling of solidarity among informed people. The so-called politicization of science: While the Science must remain Objective, the Scientist is a Person just like everyone else. We have our likes and dislikes, our preferences, our needs, our beliefs, our causes, social and otherwise. Why should we exclude ourselves? Should groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists not exist? In fact, I think that the silence of scientists imperils science and society. Score: 0.0 Science should have a legitimate place in the world, if the overall concept is that they are studying what God has created. Using the brains and body that God has given them. But, while there may still be some in the science community who are in awe of what God created that permeates their work, the March this weekend, did not show evidence of that on the whole. I\u2019ve read some comments online that actually attack religion and deny God. I find that incomprehensible that anyone who seriously looks at the world can deny God. There is no human creation, no discovery that does not begin and end with what God created. And God help us if science is all we have to rely on because they are totally inadequate for the job. And they\u2019ve taken the good that God created and twisted it into something entirely different. God created horses that were part of a human ecology for transportation and science created automobiles whose air pollution is threatening humanity. The industrial revolution brought air and water pollution, pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Monsanto is threatening our very food supply by attempting to collect all the seed in the world and tampering with it. We would not have nuclear weapons if it were not for science. And for every supposed medical advance there remain an increasing number of incurable diseases. So unfortunately, though the science community seems to view themselves as somehow doing good in the world, their track record says otherwise. Score: 7.0 Science is the process by which we learn. I can't believe we're in a place right now where Americans are advocating against learning. Score: 4.0 You can't take the high road here. Religion has always MADE an enemy of science based on opinion or faith. Science is considered an enemy because it demands evidence and often presents documented evidence that contrasts with what is believed. Galileo, Copernicus, etc have been labeled enemies based on what was essentially observation of data. The Catholic Church responded with the current pope, breaking rules and tradition to pull from the scholarly Jesuit order, which says something major. In demanding to move data-based conversation to faith, scientists by nature (best case scenario for the faithful) will lament the lack of data.

I happen to think that most people are better than you. You should have known that you were being tested. And he would not have invited you to his house unless he liked you. So the thing you objected to was his ego. But you didn't admit to that in your piece. The piece was not about Life Magazine, either. It makes no more sense to recommend Life Magazine than to recommend being born in 1945. Giving a eulogy at someone's funeral, then writing that they had a big head is uncool.

Gardener admired him enough to stay in touch. Score: 16 I don't begin to understand a mentality that would reject someone's offered friendship because of a resentment of being tested. I guess that's a male thing. I do understand wanting to have coffee with a stranger before deciding to invite the stranger home. I think Theroux lost out. And isn't wise enough to understand it. Nevertheless, one look at that face and Gardner McKay popped right into my head. I have such trouble with names now I forgot my sister's when I wanted to introduce her to someone. But I remember as a girl having a slight crush on the handsome pseudo sea captain. Who turned out to be not just an actor, but a man whose love of the sea was quite real, and who valued real adventure more than being a celebrity. He seemed like one of the genuine heroes. Score: 6 One day in the 1980's, Oxford Books had both new and used books stores. Both were equally delicious places to leisurely enjoy. I wandered about in the used book store and found a tremendous collection of Life magazines. The one I first picked up was from the 1940's, with an Army general on the cover. I found a place to sit and immediately that issue of Life transported me back to WWII. Toward the back of the magazine was a half page ad for Pond's Cold Cream, the tagline reading something like She's young, she's lovely, she's engaged, she uses Ponds Cold Cream. I gasped and said very loudly, that's my mother! She was a beautiful woman and a famous photographer in New York had taken the main photo. As the adopted daughter of her second marriage, I was looking at photos of a woman I never knew. She looked happy and the ad firmly placed her in the upper echelon of society, marrying a man from a well-known family and himself, an injured pilot who wound up in Walter Reed recovering from being shot down, a sort of war hero. I never knew much about my adoptive mother during the years she was alive. She was definitely not happy, socially isolated and given to drinking and Valium to cope with life. What pleasure it gave me to know my mother had shined, was celebrated and was full of joy. Thanks to Life magazine, I was given a window into who she was, one I never got in all our days as mother and daughter. Score: 7 Theroux is honest enough to relate his own high self-regard, paradoxical feelings of inferiority, and prickly sensitivity to being patronized by someone obviously more open-hearted and likeable than he. Like him I grew up with Life and the window it opened to the wider world.

I have encountered such drinks-preceded-by-unplanned dinner social tests, and I always felt good passing them. They have led to long term friendships and business relationships.

It feels self-serving, as if the point is that Gardner ended up forgotten, while the humble Theroux became a well-known literary star who deigned to speak at the funeral of a man he once envied but long ago surpassed.

I carried that magazine back and forth to the beach for days, until my mother told me to stop showing it to everybody. When McKay's television show, Adventures in Paradise, finally came on in September, how could it not be anticlimactic? For one thing, it was startling that he spoke in a voice other than God's. I really liked him better as mine & on a magazine cover. Score: 0 Immediately recognized Gardner McKay as soon as I saw the photo of the Life cover. As a teenager, I never missed his show, Adventures in Paradise. A girl could dream couldn't she? Score: 23 Fortunate Mr. McKay, that Theroux declined the dinner invitation. The jealous edges in this article are painful. one can only speculate. But straightforwardness does not suggest itself. This entire article is not something Mr. Theroux, to borrow his word, should crow about. Score: 4 Like Mr. Theroux, LIFE magazine was more important to me as a young kid than I realized at the time. Slow at learning to read, I devoured the photo journalism magazine each Friday as it arrived at our house. Big gorgeous pictures that told current stories from all facets of the world. But seeing it all turned out not to be enough for me and I began reading the slim writings about each photo and encouraged myself to learn how to pronounce and understand the words that opened up the photos more fully! LIFE was one of my great teachers and I miss it all the time. I remember Gardner McKay and his TV series Adventures in Paradise which ran for a couple of seasons on CBS I believe. He was everything that this kid wanted to be Am very happy to know that he had what appears to be a fully and rewarding life in Hawaii. As for Mr. Theroux, happily he is still around to fill us in on his own adventures. Score: 3 Hi Paul, I feel a bit of familiarity because we were introduced... in 1962, in the front yard of the Univ. I had just flunked out of Cornell Architecture. I am a tall, handsome, dim-witted fellow. We got Life, too, but my recollections are of movie girls with nice glands. National Geographic was the rag that instilled wanderlust. When he was 8yrs old, I gave my gran-brat Huckleberry Finn. A few weeks later, he had rigged a curtain rod in over-the-shoulder mode with an improvised sack. At the front door, he called to his mother, saying he was checking out.

The lower one's rent, the more valuable the apartment. The outrage of some of the commenters is misplaced. Some tenants, after living in an apartment for decades, paying taxes and otherwise contributing to the stability and quality of neighborhoods, have increased the value of the buildings they live in.

Also, I would not expect to be set up for life by a buyout on an apartment in Elmhurst. They offer you something like six months free rent. However, regadrless of what the tenant decides to do, keep in mind some owners never buy tenants out.

The other filling components can be varied to personal taste, but as Mr. Tanis notes, editions may tend to be more elaborate than the traditional. Use what you like and have available. Once you have the filling, rolling and phyllo under control, boreks are quite easy to make. And if you do not care for lamb, use some other ground meat!"", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Only one person says that video games are not addictive."", ""dialog history"": ""Headline: Keywords: Snippet: What does a recent study say about the number of video game players who may be addicted, as well as how they should be helped? Score: 0.0 I think that when it comes to video games the lines of addiction and relaxation are very blurred. One way to identify if you are a addict is if you think you need it and/or if it is hurting you in a negative way. This has to be up to the person and those around them to determine. It can also depend on the type of game because if you have ever looked at the marketing of a mobile game, most tend to have bright colors and a grow your city kind of mentality. Through these games they give you notifications that enforce the addiction by reminding you to consistently check if your city is growing. Through this they offer ways to grow it faster with money and so on. This can be considered more addictive then a game of Star Craft or Call of Duty that doesn't necessary positively enforce the player on a timed basis. So in conclusion I think that the chance of addiction can very from game to game based on how often the player is given positive reinforcement. I personally do believe video games are addicting. I'm not saying that's a bad thing though. I personally play video games every day if I have the time. Video games is a great way to spend free time and also to challenge the mind. Playing a video game and completing challenges gives the player happiness and the feeling of accomplishment. I can not play video games if I need to not play but it is something I would much rather be doing. Score: 1.0 Many people when they come home, they will run straight to their room, lock the door, and sit down right in front of a screen. This will usually happen every single day of their life. Has the time spent playing video games had detrimental effects on grades, work, relationships, health, sleep or any other aspect of life. All my cousins and my brother will stay up until 12pm playing their games and they start playing them at 3pm , that's nine hours of looking straight at a screen, shining right in your eyes. Most of them and many people don't do their homework which means, there grade are slowly going down like a kid on a waterside. So many people are indeed addicted to games. Score: 0.0 I believe that being addicted to video games is 100% possible, I have seen it in people lives. However, this does not mean that we need to be careful of video games, too much of anything is bad. People can become addicted to anything, and from that addiction, negatives may arise, this is not from the item itself, in this case. In saying this I do not mean that negatives only come from bad habits and negatives you created, some items may cause negatives in and of themselves such as drugs or dangerous activities. Whereas in the case of video games, the issues only arise when the user creates an issue. Everyone who smokes will see the issues the follow it, but not everyone will see the negatives of video games. video games are my favirote especially black ops 2 call of duty zombies not cause its violent but all of the extreme action is really fun and you can troll other people playing which is my liked part I personally am a little addictive to video games because i was born in the age of when video games was at it's point of FPS games and grand theft auto, as a kid my mom got me an Xbox360 and i played that thing so much that my grades started to degrade, so my mom grounded me and later on i got my grades back up and she let me play to where i was not addicted. So at this point in present day I have an XboxOne and i really only play it on the weekends because I'm in high school and I cant afford to fail my classes. But on the other hand I have a friend named Garrett that is so addicted to playing video games that he doesn't get any sleep, his grades are dropping dramatically, and his parents don't care for his education or his future life.  Some researchers even claim that these games are comparable to illegal drugs in terms of their influence on the brain \u2014 that they are \u201cdigital heroin. Video games hurt your mind like doing meth over time to your body. Video games are addictive and anyone who says otherwise has never met a video game addict. He secretly stayed up until 4 AM on school nights and would continue playing with people in different time zones when his friends went to bed. He lied about it to his family and friends. His grades went from A\u2019s to D\u2019s and F\u2019s. He lost interest in doing anything but playing video games. He was tired all the time. \u201cThat is, the mental, physical and social health of (this \u201caddict\u201d WAS) different from that of individuals who were not addicted to video games. \u201c He got help and stopped temporarily, but then couldn\u2019t help himself and started up again. I took my child to the pediatrician and was in the waiting room for over an hour. I asked the nurse what was taking so long and whether I could use the restroom. As I headed toward the restroom I saw the nurse open the door to the doctor\u2019s office to tell him that he had several patients waiting for him. He was playing video games on his office computer and didn\u2019t even turn away from the screen. The nurse shut the door, looked at me defeated, and rolled her eyes at the other nurse. We waited another 45 minutes. Video game addict. Probably fired by now. continued in next comment Score: 1.0 I spent much of the past 12 years conducting and publishing video game effects research. Some of my collaborators have studied video game addiction and I'm familiar with this research. A few points in reaction to Video Games Aren't Addictive: -Chris Ferguson has seemingly never found a negative video game effect he believed in. Casting doubt on such effects has been the central theme of his academic career. Many of his positions are contradicted by the official positions of the major scientific organizations (APA, AMA, AAP, etc.) -Those gamers who meet the addiction criteria are already reporting distress, interference with their daily lives, and an inability to cut back (that's precisely what the addiction measure is asking about). This undercuts his claim that these individuals aren't having problems. -High use and addiction are indeed not the same. I would never assume a gamer has a problem simply because they spend a lot of time playing games, but assuming that gaming CAN'T be a problem - even when the person in question feels it IS a problem for them - is not an act of kindness. -The purpose of recognizing something as an addiction is not to stigmatize it, but to help guide resources to those who find their own behaviors distressing/problematic. As both a scientist and lifelong gamer, the research literature and the experiences of some of my friends indicate that video games can be such a problem for some people. Score: 0.0 I believe that video games are not addictive. People can choose to play them or do stuff to be active. I personally would rather be outside hanging with friends then being inside playing video games. Video games to me are very boring and not interesting at all. My friend Hannah plays GTA all day. she sits on the comfy couch, eats sour candy, and cries when she looses her game. That is a waist of day, personally I don't believe video games kills brain cells. They're just a waist of time. Video games are as boring as doing homework. Statistics prove that when you play video games your grades become bad because your focused on video games more then school. Kids become barren and their grades go down the drain. I believe video games are not addictive. I believe video games are really addictive. This is because kid would rather sit down on a couch, grab controller and have fun playing video than go outside. Most kid would play video games all day without knowing it. Since kid are play video games all day they don\u2019t have time to do the necessary thing in life like home work and being health which leads to barren results. This is worse than losing a game of call of duty to your best friend. \u201cSome parent compare video game to illegal drugs in terms of their influence on the brain\u201d (matter 1). This is because video game cans numb your brain and mess with it .In conclusion video are addictive because kids play video game 24/7 and do nothing else. I personally think video games are a waste of time and stupid. I would want to be shooting the soccer balls into the goal, throwing the football with my brother, and walking around the mall with my friends. People that play video games are usually called gamers. People like this as lazy as couch potatoes , they never move of the couch and stair at the television all day long. Gamers are usually barren and don't like to do anything, they always want someone to do something for them. What is your experience with video games- or people who play them, if you personally do not? I can relate to this because i am not a big video game player, but my brother loves them. If he has nothing to do over the weekend he is going to be glued to the Xbox like shrimp on fried rice. I do not believe that video games by themselves are addictive. Its not like all gamers have this insatiable desire to play video games all day. lot of days days after school I get home, do my homework, and play video games. I typically play for one-hour sessions only. I believe that everything we do can become an addiction. I know two specific examples of men who grew up addicted to hunting and fishing. These are considered wholesome, salt-of-the-earth activities. As far away from video game addiction as you can get, right? I was never allowed to take days off from school for such activities, but they were. Vacations, both as children, and then as adults, would often revolve around travelling out of state to hunt or fish. There is nothing wrong with any of these things, and plenty of very good husbands, fathers, and employees have similar upbringing. But, in these two cases, they are not good fathers, divorced, and generally only interested in their self-serving needs to get to the next fix of a good hunting or fishing outing. - A rabid NASCAR fan, acquaintance of mine, who is barely functional when he's not following racing. His choice of living arrangements, vehicles, time off of work, etc. all revolve around the NASCAR season and following the races. - The selfie addicted friend who needs to show every point of progress with his cross-fit and lifting routine. - Many other examples, such as friend X who spends thousands of dollars on comic books and comic conventions, or friend Y who spends most free time researching bourbon, tours bourbon distilleries, and takes special trips to procure 1 hard-to-get bottle of something. None of these examples are the norm, just as the WoW burnouts and other video game junkies are not the norm. Video games are as addictive as any other activity. Personality types (and disorders), environmental factors, and social factors determine who will become truly addicted, and to what level. Before video game addiction, there were movies, MTV, and music. I remember groups who would sit around endlessly discussing the merits of various drummers and bands. Some would have their little cults of grunge band followers. Others would watch Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python, or endless slasher films. There have always been sports fanatics who can barely function when not talking about their favorite team(s) and self-identify with them. There are those who are addicted to physical fitness perfection, body building, endurance running, etc. NASCAR fanaticism. The list can go on and on. And every single example can develop to a level of addiction that they are destructive to healthy relationships, success at work/school, etc. Being a 15-year old playing videos daily, almost always on my phone, or watching T.V.. But it can definitely get addicting. And I totally agree with the article that it is not a bad thing go be addicted to. Consider a common diagnostic question used to help identify addiction, such as \u201cI always use X to relax after a bad day.\u201d Well, if X is methamphetamine, that\u2019s a worrisome choice, one that presumably indicates addiction. But if X is playing vide o games, how is that different from unwinding after work by knitting, watching sports or playing bridge? You can't just compare playing video games to doing drugs. They are completely different. I personally have never had a video-game addiction and don't know how you can. Video games aren't the real menace and aren't addictive like Christopher Ferguson stated Playing video games is not addictive in any meaningful sense. The closest I've become to video game addiction is that over the summer I would play video games for hours, go to bed at the end of the day, and repeat the next day. But once I had school I would play games substantially less and focus on school. I think that video game addiction can be a real problem, but an easy solution may to just unplug your system every once in a while. In my opinion I think video games are very addictive. I don't play video games, but my brother does and I know that he is sort of addicted. Video games are a waste of time There are so many things I would rather be doing like, traveling to the Bahamas to adventure a new country, going to Disneyland like I'm a little kid again, and something as simple as working out. If you're spending your time playing video games now imagine when you're a 30-year-old and you are a couch potato. Video games are barren in your life nothing at all comes out of playing video games. For example my brother likes to play video games and that is literally all he does when he gets home from school. Stop playing video games and have some social interaction! I have occasionally wanted to keep playing a game but it's rare for there to be a game that i will want to play for hours on end. It also helps that my parents have rules for the amount of time i can play video games to time per day and the amount of days per week. At first i was upset about it but as i got older and started playing outside more i realized the wisdom of having those rules in place. It was like a net that trapped my mind even though i wasn't addicted to the games. I could see that it had begun to degrade at my social life. But now i realize how much time i was spending on the games and now i only play up to 2 hours some days. I commented below, on my experience with addiction to a game. I would also like to mention another Addiction related reality of Video Games. I have seen, Drug Addicts, kick drugs, by becoming addicted to a game! This is the main proof. If you can replace one addiction with another addiction, then it is truly an addiction, and some games are more powerful then the most powerful drugs like opium. If you do not think this is proof enough, then you are a google head, who can see no practical proof in anything, and are already addicted to the industrial complex video game called google. I personally, do not have an addictive personality , I do not drink much,smoke,or prescribe to many habits at all. In fact, most video games can not draw me in for more then a few hours. However, back in 2005 I wanted to try World of Warcraft, because I viewed it as good potential for the internet. Soon enough, it was all I could think about, and even though I tried very hard to balance my life, with the game, the game does not leave your mind when you leave the game. I had such a good time playing this game, that I look back fondly often to events,I can never really replicate again. I became a really good, well known pvp figure on my server, and got invited to an accomplished guild, which back then was a lot of work, and time. The game however, drained my real life, of almost everything, I lost almost everything because of it. On top of that, WoW released and expansion called burning crusade, I lost everything, in the game that I worked so hard for. Because the game had destroyed real life, and the game had destroyed my game life, It was a pretty heavy blow. To say that these types of games are addictive, is an understatement! These games potentially can drain your life, and make you sick,Fat,depressed,confused, and lost, left to rebuild a life with no Mana. After years of observation I have concluded, that it is intentional, and not just an accident."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

I am a woman of 65 and I get so angry at people offering me seats on the train just because I have grey hair I work out at the gym every single day for over 2 hours (1 hour interval cardio, then weights, then dynamic stretching) and twice a week I do pilates. I could do more pushups than anyone yet that has offered me a seat.

Sports are evolving all the time, and I don't think that you can change your sport except changing playing time and some little rules . To Modify big things would be changing the core of sports. i disagree with this. i would change some things about baseball but its so dumb how they say oh putting on gloves just take too much time. but yes the break are very long but i kinda agree then disagree of for doing something with the inngs because yea the game does take too long and most people would stop watching ny the 7 inns but i think it doesnt matter because lets see you go to a baseball game. you spent good money for a good but if the game end too early whats the whole point because for me i think the game time is just fine. but the main problem is the starting time and how much games they play in a week. but now back to the breaks or commercials and yeas i do agree with that it is too long and yes like in the world series it took so long like 8min just wating. another thing i disgree with is there should still be 4 balls and 3 strikes. i dont think every foul ball should count as a strike . lets say your 3-2 and you keep hiting the ball but its fouls i thinks its fine because then everyone can have even more chances to be in bat or hit the ball. but overall base should just change some things not all and just stay with 9 no 7. I have to agree on the fact that baseball games are long, too long for many to sir down and try and stay focused on the game for the entirety of it. The suggestion to make the commercial breaks shorter is definitely a great option as there tends to be various commercial breaks between baseball games and other sports as well. I agree that Baseball games are long and last about 3 hours because of the innings, ads, and too many active players. Shorten ads is a good idea because the ads actually really get annoying and they are long. This will make the baseball games finish quicker. I also agree with having less active players per games because this will change the game to go quicker because the coach doesn\u2019t have to worry too much about making sure every player plays. I also agree with shorten the game from nine innings to seven innings. I disagree with counting a foul ball with as a strike out because that would give the batter less chances to actually hit the ball to a home run. I agree that we should change some things about baseball. Baseball games are too long to watch and should have the commercials shorter. The only thing that makes baseball games longer are the commercials. They should cut the commercials by a lot of time because the commercials can be up to 2 minutes. Baseball shouldn't have overtimes. If the game is tied then it's tied. I believe that if they do have overtime, the most time given is an inning. 9 innings is a lot already, and when it goes overtime it's even more innings. I would have to agree that Baseball games are too long, but only when you watch them at home. As shown in the Article I am not the only one who thinks that the commercials are way too long especially during important games because while I'm getting notifications on ESPN that Dodgers are scoring, I'm still watching a Budweiser commercial and as I think about it now I can see why people find baseball so boring because as soon as an inning finishes the throw like 3 minute commercials that can really be frustrating. Which is why I think they should cut out 30 seconds of commercials like the artilce stated. If I could change my favorite sport I\u2019d change basketball. If I could change basketball I would make the quarters longer in the game. is not enough time in one basketball game. 4 quarters isn\u2019t enough. I think that goes to all sports actually though. Seem like the game doesn\u2019t end fairly because it\u2019s not enough time also the referees don\u2019t actually call plays in time nor at the right time. 5 quarters seem like the right amount because its longer and athletes can demonstrate to their best ability. People think that baseball is too long. A lot of people think that the league should make games shorter because according to the article Baseball\u2019s Too Slow. Here\u2019s How You Fix It, it says, \u201cThe average game last season took three hours. This shows how long t baseball games have been in the last season. Three hours is a really long time if you ask me. The article also provided ways to fix these really long games. One way the article mentions to make baseball games shorter is to shorten all the ads. In the same article it says, \u201cWant the game to move more quickly? This just means that the one showing the games on TV should just make commercial breaks shorter. This can be helpful because some people think that the commercial breaks are too long. If they shorten the all of the commercial breaks then this could make games go buy quicker on TV. Another way of making baseball games shorter is to not have so many innings. Baseball games always have 9 innings. They could have even more if the two teams go into overtime. In the article it talks about how if the league cut games down to only seven innings then they could save a lot of time. This means that instead of having all nine innings they should only have seven. Well this isn\u2019t just for my favorite sport it goes for all sports I think they should start back letting the 5 Star above all other top athlete\u2019s go straight to the pro\u2019s from High School. I know they stopped that so athletes could get their education but not everybody is that good so it\u2019s not like the High School athletes in the nation will be drafted out of high school but only a small percent. I didn\u2019t agree with any suggestions about changing baseball. I think the games are long enough if they have them any longer than people would lose interest. If I could change anything about any sport I would make it where each team would have to have a certain amount of girls and boys. If I could change anything about school sports it would be the seasons. I would make some last longer than others. For example, I really like basketball so I would make the season just a little bit longer and I would make soccer shorter because I don\u2019t really like it. I don't think you should change the rules in any sport because it will change the game as a whole. My go-to sport is volleyball and if i had to change a rule in the game it would be the only touch the ball once rule. I think this could make the game more fun and more exciting to watch, but i don't think you should change the rules in any sport because it will change the game as a whole. Baseball is too slow. My favorite sport is softball i tend to think that baseball does take a long time. They should consider entertaining the crowd more, so they can't get bored. Reducing ads would be a great idea, because no one came to see some ads that they might not even remember. The games can take as long as WW1. Baseball is too slow. Score: 1 Some of things that can help baseball games move quicker is cutting the commercial breaks by 30 seconds each. If they want to get more fans then put the games on fox sports then on the hard to find fox sports 1, make the World Series an appointment viewing and if you want to appeal young fans then let them watch a game before bedtime. The last time I went to a baseball game I didn\u2019t get home till 12 at night. The game went to 12 innings and I fell asleep through the 7-10 innings. I was so tired when I got home I didn\u2019t wake up till 11 the next day and it was a school day. Although I didn\u2019t get I trouble for sleeping in I still was mad at myself for not getting up on time. I haven\u2019t been to a baseball game since. I agree with this article that baseball games need to end quicker than they do now. Score: 0 My favorite sport is motocross. In my opinion it is the most physically-demanding sport that I have experienced throughout my childhood. Motocross requires you to workout on a regular basis, eat healthy as much as you can, and to have plenty of time to practice at the track. Professional sports bother me because they have way to many restrictions and with motocross, it is a one man team which allows you to race and train as much as you want and when you want. My favorite sport is football, and in my opinion, I think there\u2019s too many penalties, and the league is too strict. All the penalties make the game soft. Like for example, Unnecessary Roughness. Football is meant to be played rough. Also, penalties on the defense make the offense very overpowered, like roughing the passer and pass interference. Players should be allowed to fight, like in hockey. Also, players are only allowed to wear custom cleats one week in the NFL. For example, Odell Beckham Jr. was fined a whopping $18,000 dollars for wearing custom cleats that honored the late Craig Sager. Odell said \u201cI got fined 18k for Craig Sager cleats that were auction off the cleats to the highest bidder and donating the proceeds to his cancer research.\u201d Players also constantly get fined for their celebrations. People are starting to call the NFL the \u201cNo Fun League.\u201d The athletic wide receiver with a determined attitude leaped over the cornerback and snagged the ball out of the air. Then, was fined for dancing in the end zone. Players should also be allowed to put nicknames on the back of their jerseys. My favorite sport is football and I do think some aspects of the game has to be changed. I think one major thing that needs to happen is roughing the passer is called way to much the defense will touch the quarterbacks arm with there hand after he throws it and he will get a penalty that gives the offense 10-yards. Also a lot of players are getting less and less aggressive they're like girls. These are some problems with the NFL i'm sure there are billions of different problems out there but these are a few that I think is most important. My favorite sport is soccer. If I was going to change it in any way it would be your allowed to use your hands once a game for 5 seconds. It would kind of be unfair but you can strip the ball from people but that is your hands for the game, It can make game faster pace, and if you have a person that can throw far you can have him make crazy throws to people. Like you can make 20-yard throws to the middle of the field. This is why my favorite sport is soccer. well my favorite sport is baseball and it will probably always will be. if i was to change my sport it would have to be badminton because you can hit the bride and it will barely go any where that's my 2nd favorite sport I don't think changing sports is the right idea, especially when your changing the whole sport, Thats like changing a state to a completely different state. You might as well make a new sport. I am a skateboarder and skateboarding changes a lot but i just skate the way i want to, and i just skate every day, all day. I wake up, get dressed, eat, and then skate all day I think changing a sport isn't the right thing to do if you wanted to change the sport i think you should make a whole new sport, but if i were to change any sport it would be soccer. When i was about 10-years-old i started to realize the refs started getting really bad and i thought that if we could make any new rule it would be to have many cameras all over the field to assist the refs with some of the calls they make.

Score: 0 The first question should be what kind of steam fed radiator is it? Single line or return line? Most of the comments here seem to be addressing single line systems, where the hot steam comes up via a riser, then stops when the building thermostat or timer indicates the building has complied with heat delivery, and returns the steam, condensed, back to the boiler, via the same line. Knocking or loud concussive sounds can occur when descending condensed water encounters rising steam in single return lines. Double return line systems send hot steam up via a feed and return condensate via the 'return line' to the basement. They use more pipe so they're less common and far quieter, but, can have problems too if improperly blocked or poorly maintained. In single line systems the radiator should be pitched to drip back into the 'feed' valve side. In return line systems it should be pitched to drain in the direction the return line exits. Release valves help prevent surges in pressure from blowing up your radiator. They aren't supposed to drip and ruin your floor and your downstairs neighbor's ceiling. People warning that you should be sure the heat is off before removing the valves are correct. You also don't want the valves being poorly attached with inadequate 'packing' and getting blown off, with hot steam filling your apartment and causing all sorts of damage. If you find any of the above intimidating, bribe or tip your super to take care of your valves. I'm struggling with the same problem right now. This is NOT a plumbing problem, this is a HVAC issue. The landlord needs to pay a specialist to evaluate the entire building. First, is your radiator raised? Under the vent, there should be a 1-inch piece of wood tilting it towards the knob. Second, go for the brand Horton for vents. Third, there are a variety of vent sizes, so pending if your apartment is too hot/cold dictates the size of the vent. Finally, if the landlord doesn't comply, you might want to work w/your neighbors to get the whole building balanced. Someone else's radiator could be causing your issues if the above doesn't work. Score: 4 Whenever the air valve is removed from the radiator, there is danger of escaping steam and burns. Be certain to turn off the steam supply or shutoff valve that is frequently located near the floor. This often has a large plastic knob. Score: 3 if you wrap the valve in a towel and tie it, it will be a temporary fix. I did that in my apartment for years. Score: 0 A new valve costs less than $10. Newer valves also let you adjust them. Score: 17 It\u2019s good advice to change the air valve. As someone here noted, once it heats up it should close down, and no air should escape, preventing hissing. It\u2019s a very simple thing to do, and your super or a handyman can do it. They need to wrap the threads with Teflon tape in the proper direction so that it doesn\u2019t get disturbed while screwing it into the hole in the radiator. It also needs to be done while the radiator is cold, not when heat is coming up to avoid being scalded by steam. I wouldn\u2019t quibble over who pays for this; you want to sleep better, just do it. The advice from the lawyer who says that a hissing radiator violates the warrantee of habitability is ridiculous, and an overreach. Not having heat would violate the warrantee of habitability. Complain to a judge in housing court about a hissing radiator, and you\u2019re likely to get laughed at and advised that you are lucky you have heat.

Score: 2 As an interim solution, how about just turning off the radiator completely and using an oil-filled electric radiator while you sleep? Score: 7 The reason for not doing this is that the shut offs on individual radiators are not intended to be used on a daily basis. They are there to shut the steam to the radiator in the event of a repair, or to shut a radiator off and leave it off. In an old central steam system that may not be well maintained, it\u2019s a good way to get a leak at the shut off valve, and the tenant who shut it would then be held responsible for the cost of replacing the shut off valve, which not only requires a plumber, but could necesssitate more work than simply threading a new shut off into place. Score: 6 The letter writer asks, Is there is a way to fix this? The plumber says, There are no solutions. But if the letter writer were a homeowner and the plumber said that, would she believe him? Of course not, there must be a way to fix this. The radiator is making an incredibly loud noise. Hardly anyone understands steam heating nowadays. It's a fine technology when it's working well. If there's a lot of clanging, that's caused by an improper arrangement of piping in the boiler room, and it may take a lot of work to fix it. But a hissing vent should be simple. David of Flushing obviously knows a good deal. If your valve hisses loudly, it probably doesn't close, and it's letting steam out Replace it. If it's a silver bullet, maybe another of those will do, but for a few more dollars you can buy a Gorton valve, which is of higher quality. If you're interested in exploring the subject, the book is The Lost Art of steam Heating by Dan Holohan. BTW, Ms. Pillon's drawing shows a vent at the bottom of a radiator; it would really be at least halfway up at the end opposite that of the valve. Score: 8 I should add that my father-in-law, who had kept the old radiator valves, put them back on when we left. Score: 27 When we lived in a rental apartment, we fixed things. The linoleum in our pre-war kitchen was ragged, so we ripped it up and put down linoleum squares. The black linoleum in the hallway and foyer was coming off on our bare feet -- I think it must have been put on by the first tenant -- pretty awful. We pulled it up to find exquisite parquet, on which we had to use boiling water and Mex in order to get up all the old glue, and then we shellacked it. Some mold spots on the bathroom ceiling? Wash it with diluted bleach and paint it with anti-mildew paint. We were there for over twenty years. Our building manager, pleasant and reliable, took care of plumbing, heating, and paint jobs. Radiator valves? My father-in-law had some better ones than what was there (or what, probably, the manager would give us), installed them, and removed them when we bought a house. All of which is to say: Tenants are not helpless. Just because we pay rent doesn't mean that we can't make our living conditions nicer. It might be a rental apartment, but it's your apartment. Buy a valve. Get a plumber to put it on if you're unsure whether you can or not. But it's really an easy task. Don't forget to use silicon tape.

My landlord and managing agent is a lot less forgiving. If I named them, you would understand my position. Score: 0 You see, Landless, our landlord and building manager actually did maintain the apartment building. It was clean, there was plenty of heat and hot water, and when something leaked, it got fixed. Cosmetic upgrades like exposing parquet floors or redoing curling linoleum -- that's usually beyond what long-time, rent-stabilized tenants get. As it was, our rent was, comparatively speaking, low. Many of our neighbors were in their 70s and 80s and had been in the building from the start. Others, in their forties, had been born in the building. This landlord didn't -- couldn't -- charge a lot. A noisy radiator doesn't mean you're not getting heat. Some landlords are parasites. Score: 16 If the air valve continues to hiss once the radiator is hot, it is defective and needs to be replaced. Only room temperature air should come out of it. There are a number of air valve designs and not all are of the silver bullet form. Often there is a number on the valve which is the manufacturer's size designation. The larger the vent hole, the faster air escapes from the steam pipe. In theory, the steam system should be balanced. Often this means having smaller holed valves near the boiler and larger ones in more distant places. When done properly, steam reaches all the radiators at the same time. In practice, people turn off radiators in overheated apartments so that more air has to escape from those radiators that are still turned on. The main downfall of air valves is particles of rust that lodge in the narrow exhaust channel. These can prevent steam from entering a radiator (steam is denser than air) or prevent the valve from closing causing constant hissing. The rust can even form an efficient whistle. As mentioned, air valves are cheap and easily changed by the super---no plumber is required. Score: 9 I know David is knowledgeable b/c our building hired a steam heating consultant many years ago to help with clanging pipes & uneven heat distribution, and that consultant DID balance our system to the point where the heat was as even as possible, and the system was virtually silent. He always told us that if your steam heat system is making noise, *something* is wrong somewhere - whether it's a valve that needs replacing, a radiator that's not pitched correctly, etc. We paid that consultant a good amount of money for his services & it was well worth every penny! David here is giving everyone very good advice & info for FREE, so listen up! Score: 14 If the super seems competent, also get him//her to buy the replacement valve and reimburse the cost. Otherwise call Mr. Krause, the pumber mentioned in this article, and hire him or one of his people to do the work.

Score: 0 I had 16 weeks of the red devil and Taxol for Stage IIIB breast cancer during the summer of 2015 in Austin (which lasted from mid-March through at least mid-October). I was GLAD to lose my hair in the 100+-degree temperatures, and even though I spent money on a full cranial prosthesis I rarely wore it. My only complaint was losing my eyelashes and caterpillar-like eyebrows [which still haven't completely come back]; I decided that if people had a problem with my baldness it was THEIR problem. Made my life a lot easier! Score: 2 In Germany, where I reside and underwent early-stage neo adjuvant breast cancer treatment, I tried the DigniCap for two EC treatments. Unfortunately my thick curly hair insulated my scalp from the treatment. Even after I cut my hair between treatments into a very short pixie cut, I lost large patches of hair and ended up canceling my treatment. The DigniCap treatment is seldom available in treatment centers in Germany and is never covered by health insurance. Instead, insurance offers a generous subsidy for a wig (in my case, 600 EUR). I didn't want a wig, so opted to wear a thick cashmere hat and poked some of my remaining hair out the front and sides. I didn't mind losing my head hair; I found losing my eyebrows and eyelashes more haunting. But just like everything else in cancer treatment, people's bodies reacts differently to treatment, so I guess trying the cold cap is worth a try. Losing head hair is discouraging and sad, but it is not the worst aspect of cancer treatment; it is a small price to pay for continued good health. Score: 1 Interesting concept. The approach would work for male patients too, of course. As a male cancer survivor, who went quite bald from the chemo, I am less disturbed by the thought of hair loss, but I wonder if cooling the head during treatment might not help reduce the severity of 'chemo brain'? Another important issue for younger male patients is the potential genetic damage done to our reproductive cells. I was advised to bank sperm if I was planning on becoming a parent, but it seems like a similar approach could be used to protect the testicles from collateral damage. Of course there is a risk that these measures would also protect metastatic cancer cells, so caution is warranted with some cancers, such as cutaneous lymphomas. Yet again we spend research time and money on alleviating symptoms caused by toxic treatments, instead of finding less toxic treatments. Until doctors consider quality of life the most crucial aspect of treatment, they will not fight hard enough to discover what cancer really is and how best to vanquish it. We are still at a shockingly primitive level of medical treatment of cancer. The body is an effective fighter against disease. So the question is--why does cancer so often best the immune system? How do we strengthen and bolster the body's own defenses? Cancer is big business in this country, and unfortunately in other more enlightened countries too, apparently. Simpler, easier, cheaper treatments will put too many institutions and their physicians out of business. We should be looking at the big picture and not small segments of it. Nobody : In many areas of medicine we repeatedly find that older, cheaper, more effective, less toxic drugs are abandoned for newer, more dangerous, much more expensive ones. Exploration of botanically-derived medicines are limited to those where an active ingredient can be isolated, synthesized and patented--when most botanicals work synergistically as wholes, and not parts. But the whole botanical cannot be patented. It was discovered years ago that severe withdrawal symptoms could be alleviated within 48 hours by round-the-clock administration of oral and intravenous vitamin C--an exceedingly cheap treatment. Why isn't that done everywhere? Because rehab centers are big, big business. And you think that cancer treatment is not also dominated by the profit motive?

Score: 4 I am a recently retired oncology nurse. Mainly dealt w/ breast cancer patients over the last 20 years. The whole point of systemic chemotherapy is to destroy any hidden cancer cells in the entire body that local therapy i.e. surgery & radiation can't reach. To deliberately isolate one part of the body from the chemo raises the risk of having those cells missed & allowing them to return. As another writer pointed out, you will still lose hair over the rest of your body. Only long term, 5- 10 year studies will tell us if this is really a safe solution to the problem.

My mother used an ice pack on her head while traveling to and from her successful chemotherapy treatments for stage 3 Lymphoma in 1980. She lost very little hair and I know it contributed to keeping her spirits up while she underwent treatment. Score: 1 As a knitter, I'm suddenly envisioning how one could knit a hat with a pocket opening from the bottom to about the top to slide an ice pack into. Your typical ice pack is 7x14 and one of those and a smaller one together should provide about the right length to go around the head. Your typical hat starts decreasing at the top at about 7 and a bit. If someone can't afford the treatment and wants to do it themselves, it seems doable to me. It would be less perfect a method but certainly better than not trying. Great idea. I noticed the temperature is at the coldest temperature I've ever experienced (at night on a ski weekend): Cold caps and scalp cooling systems are tightly fitting, strap-on, helmet-type hats filled with a gel coolant that\u2019s chilled to between -15 to -40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Score: 4 The idea that you can protect the live follicle from the poison of chemotherapy by minimizing exposure to circulating blood is fascinating , it seems so obvious, and simple. I think it would feel relaxing, as well, at least for the stronger patients. I do know of cancer patients who experiences extreme cold sensitivity from chemo. I don't understand the obsession over hair loss myself. And since eyebrows and even eyelashes may fall out as well, the cap does only part of the job. The statement that it's unfair for some patients to have this hair loss preventative, while others can't afford it or get covered for it, made me angry. Since when is medical insurance coverage or medical treatment evenly allotted in this country? The entire healthcare system is unfair at its core. Is it fair that one person gets covered for this nonessential extra, when another has to fight her insurer to cover an essential procedure? I had chemo in the late 90's for early stage breast cancer. I was given an ice cap during treatment. Keeping my hair was a bright spot as I sufferred from the horrendous side effects of the chemo. Score: 7 I used Penguin Cold Caps seven years ago during chemo for early breast cancer, with the encouragement of Dr. Rugo at UCSF and the support of a great group of friends who helped me through 12 weeks of infusions.

I am posting to Facebook Score: 5 Losing my hair was the least of the devastation chemo (for breast cancer) wrecked on my body (mouth sores that continued down my esophagus, my finger nails fell off, as did my toe nails, ice-pick pain hammered my bones, couldn't eat-- food tasted metallic, barely walked, then neuropathy set in my hands and feet... I still can't feel the bottoms of my feet, then ended up hospitalized With 2 blood transfusions). My hair grew back just fine. A cap won't stop anyone from losing their nose, eyebrow or pubic hair.

I will never subject myself to this kind of cure with lifelong side effects again. theslowdancewithcancer.com Score: 4 Has this been tried with other forms of cancer? Why only breast cancer?

Men stress about losing their hair from chemo as well. And men can and do get breast cancer. And those who identify as trans? Are they not included? Given the many basic and necessary things medical insurers are not covering these days, a hair loss preventative cap is very low on the list of things to shame the insurance companies for. The hair grows back. I have watched relatives go through this and hair loss was the least of their worries. Oh, my, EVERYTHING is something to shame the insurance companies for. They deprive people of all kinds of comforts because of their profit aims, their obscene salary needs and their desire/need to pay their stockholders before their claims. They should be ASHAMED of themselves (as if) but nickel-and-diming patients for whom the treatment is as traumatic as the disease when there is a relatively inexpensive solution to prevent some of that trauma. They will provide wigs; why not prevent the need for a wig? They will be as cruel as they can be, until there is a public outcry forcing them to act in a humane manner. Let it begin here. Hair loss is RARELY a minor worry for people undergoing chemo; it's one of many, and wouldn't it be nice if it could be minimized? You are cold, cold, cold. Yes, men do get breast cancer (my father died of it) but at 1% the rate of women; for men, who are generally older than women when diagnosed, baldness is usually less of an issue.

A cashless society leads to consolidation where competition leaves only 3 granite merchants standing who have branches throughout India and all the others become their employees and the gynecologists are all forced into group practices where they share staff and equipment and don't have to work 14 hour days while keeping an eye on the cash drawer all the time. None of this is possible in a cash based society. In western nations, cashless societies emerged organically over a 100 years.

Unless one has to, no one will pay for anything. Everything is stolen by those who can (water, electricity, goods and services). It is not just the mobs that will loot, pillage, burn, and destroy at the slightest cause, the upper classes will withhold payment from vendors and servants . whomever, and brag about it. Working as a purchase manager in a firm is a coveted position; goods and services are accepted, and then no payment is made until bribes are given.

Score: 0 We had 4 wines to try, none were the suggested wines but two were from recommended wineries. first we tried them direct from the bottle and decanted. the wines direct from the bottle all had aromas of fruit, some minerality, but that faded quickly. all the decanted wines were softer than the wines still in the bottles but aroma was severely lacking. then we did a blind tasting of the four wines. three of us preferred the $37 wine - dominio do beibi lalama, and three of us preferred the $13 wine - vinos de arganza flavium. the difference between them and a third wine at $25 - finca milara lagarize, was negligible though. the fourth wine, arganza lagar at $18, was thin, astringent, unappealing. the wines were all better with cheese, particularly brie. great with roasted pork. superb with chocolate birthday cake. and by the end of the meal even the wine none of us cared for had disappeared. We decided to pair Decima 2014 with Lomo Saltado, our favorite Peruvian takeout food. The wine immediately impressed us with its strong floral fragrance. My wife claimed it was like drinking a bouquet. I thought it tasted of berries (strawberry, blackberry). The food was unfolding more and more of the floral qualities of this wine. I thought of lilies, my wife of gardenias. There was a mineral finish to it (slate?). We enjoyed Vi\u00f1a Caneiro 2012 with Octopus and boiled potatoes (Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s recipe I used before). The Cork smelled like marshmallows. My wife thought the wine wasn\u2019t fragrant. I found it was aromatic, medicinal, refined, berry-like and very earthy. We agreed it was a vegetable with earthy and herbal qualities and very different from the Decima. I thought somewhat like a Cabernet franc. I got a beet, graphite, earthy and later gummibear-like flavors. For Gu\u00edmaro Ribeira Sacra Tinto 2015 we choose Lomo Saltado again. The Cork was smelling very fruity. We found the wine more fruity then the others, but less floral then Decima. I again got an impression of frothy but dry strawberries. I found it aromatic like a Pinot Noir. We both identified a slate-like minerality. Score: 1 I didn't come up w/ satisfying matches for Ribeira Sacra and so perhaps I didn't get the full expression and potential of the wines. I found them bewildering: juicy, tart, slightly bitter, squirmy and frustrating; but also honest and unpretentious. They smelled of sweat and animal, oozing fruit juice, yet not grape but cranberry, and tasted best in room temp. Out of the 3, Decima was the most interesting. On pour it smelled of animal, leather, earth, and minerals (rocks). Tart, lemony-lime, and desirably bitter, it felt slightly tannic. As it evolved in a glass and into the next day, it became more balanced, maintaining freshness and red fruit. Guimaro was my least favorite. It smelled of animal sweat, and berries: cranberries and blackberries; earth and dirt; became purified like fresh, wet air with a saline, mineral quality. Initial flavors erupted into a blast of red fruit, light, pure and tart with a peppery bite and a dab of minerality. The food intensified acidity in the wine and altered its character and body to thinner, elusive, tighter. D. Venura smelled sweeter: fruit, exotic spice, Cajun spices, gently of animal; and tasted slightly bitter, beef jerky Nana said and a wild animal w/o the sweat. Ribeira Sacra did fine w/ strong, distinct flavors: marinated roasted tomatoes, jalape\u00f1o sauce, brined calamata olives, Spanish olives, sun dried tomato marinade and salad in balsamic vinaigrette. Wine made for a distinct cuisine with fresh, bursting flavors. We had the D\u00e9cima with pan-seared salmon in a soy lime sauce, and a simple tomato onion salad. The D had been my second-favorite at a quick, foodless tasting of all three, but with dinner, Barb and I agreed, this seafood pairing far outshone either of my first two tries, with the G and the DV, and meat. At the tasting, and again with food, the D was the most elegant and complex of this month\u2019s wines: regal, violet tone, red black fruitiness, a dour, sour gravitas, and a mouthfeel at once creamy and zippy. It was a bit too sour for the salmon alone, but it all balanced out with the added soy lime. The violet and fruit flavors were nice complements. The D\u2019s acidity easily handled the tomato-and-onion salad. The flavor combination was unusual, with the wine\u2019s dark, sour notes contrasting oddly with the sunny, bright food. It was a fascinating mix, and gave the simple salad an attitude that you don\u2019t quite expect from a simple salad. I\u2019d try it again for a change of pace. This is not one of those wines Eric sometimes assigns that plays a flawless supporting role, quietly making everything else at the table shine. The D\u00e9cima\u2014violet, high-toned, juicy\u2014is a bawdy contessa, and commands attention. Move along, happy readers. No fun here. My RS food pairings have been letdowns. Previously, it was the Guimaro and skirt steak in smoky almond sauce. Wednesday night, it was the D. Ventura with flank steak and olive tapenade Both wines went ok. Both did better with the plain meat than with the toppings, which were the more interesting parts of their respective meals. Neither pairing will be soon repeated. The DV was light, almost bubbly, fresh and zippy, with the meat. Barb and I both found it an adequate partner to the food; both of us wished for a wine with a bit more heft. What impressed me most was the DV\u2019s chalky minerality, less prominent than its raspberry flavor, but more distinctive. It was also, I suspect, the attribute that let the wine even handle the very salty tapenade. Overall, I\u2019ve had seven different Mencias, about a dozen times, and still can\u2019t tell if it better suits meat or fish. My most knowledgeable wine friend calls it a difficult wine to pair. Odd dishes, like monkfish and chorizo; or pasta with bacon, prunes and orange; or pasta with sausage and bitter greens have been hits. Others, like tuna or dry sausage or even a simple grilled flank steak, surprise failures. At 67th St.\u2019s RS tasting, the DV stood out as my favorite. The salesman gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to my idea of a soy lime salmon. he said, \u201cyou need that bit of citrus to brighten it up.\u201d Citrus, and salt, too, I think. Last night at my Restaurant (Justa Pasta) i hosted the first, of what I hope to be many, Sunday Suppers.  Each month we will trying the wines suggested in wine school and having dinner. The decima was unavailable and therefor Ireplaced it with the '12 Lalama -- PDX Wines had all 3 and my wine rep who has been to the region and to the wineries on serveral occasions attended the evenings festivities and opened with a 20 minute talk. She also brought 3 older vintages (Lalama '09 and '10 and an '08 D Ventura). I started the dinner with Spanish almonds, campo de mantalban cheese and Cava from Avinyo. As we opened the wines, everyone had all 3 glasses in front of them. I then served bruschetta with blistered patron peppers. People like the simplicity and restraint from the Guimaro. It was the leanest of the 3 and seemed to pair well with this simple food. The last course was fried cauliflower served over romesco, grilled flatiron steak with saut\u00e9ed red onions and a saffron, seafood risotto with prawns and calamari. These foods required the extra umph exhibited in the Lalama and especially the D Ventura. the Lalama had a very nice nose and was definitely reminiscent of an Oregon Gamay Noir. On the palate, however, it was much stonier and had very subtle berry flavors. The D Ventura was the boldest and had the most depth. All of the wines exhibited great minerality. The '08 D V was the most popular of the older vintages. Score: 0 Bibei Lalama 2012 was lacking on the nose, mostly minerals, smoke and wet earth, tight, reticent in the mouth with sour (pleasant) red fruits, went well with a creamy tomme but pretty unexciting in general. Paired with garlic sausage with peppers and onions it still fell short, just not much there. Gu\u00edmaro Meixeman 2011 had the slightest hint of creamy texture from oak ageing. It had the feel of a restrained CA pinot or burgundy both on the nose and in the mouth, cola and cherry but other earthy flavors present and hints of pepper. Just a undercurrent of minerality and medium weight without heavy tannins, very pleasing with basic mediterranean pizza. After time it was much brighter with sharper fruits giving it a leanness that was not present at first. How does a wine get tighter with air? This was really fun and intriguing. Algueira Carravel 2013-reticent on the nose but firm and grippy with a great deal of elegance and structure that the other two did not have, more herbal, restrained and balanced, nice interplay between the mineral and sweetness, this was by far the most exciting bottle as it showed great range from nose to finish. Served with poulet roti with a olive herb rub and roasted veggies proven\u00e7al and the blossoming acidity paired well. Overall, given the diversity of these wines it was hard to sense the style of the region or get a sense of menc\u00eda since one was like burgundy, another more like a Montsant and another weakly pointing at gamey from the Loire. We sampled the Decima first and we found it fragrant and ready to drink. On the nose we observed notes of cherry and pomegranate. On the palate we found it somewhat tart with slate overtones. The taste and the bouquet did not seem to match. It was served with a root vegetable risotto where the cream in the dish seemed to overwhelm the wine. It was not a good food match. We found the Guimaro another \u201cimmediate pleasure\u201d wine. It seemed fairly one dimensional with hints of spice and mineral. For those of us that had had the Mencia grape before, it truly showed a sense of terroir. It was served with a duck breast and a chili potato puree. The spiciness of the wine and food offerings seemed to meld perfectly. The food and the wine did not over-power each other. It was our favorite wine and food pairing. Lastly, we tried the Caneiro. We found this wine to be rounder, more complex and offering a beautiful nose with layers of cocoa, coffee and nutmeg. With food, a chili rubbed lamb loin, we noticed the fruit in the wine start to show itself. This was our favorite wine and a great match with the food, but not as good as # 2. We all look forward to trying more offerings of the Mencia grape.

I live in Poland, in Warsaw and I was so unable to get any of the recommended bottles so I just bought what I managed to find. Anyways, I bought Lagariza from the Fincamillara, 2015. The wine was very pleasant on its own. With deep red color, some leather and earthy scents, it opened wonderfully after swirling revealing opulent red fruit notes (mostly cherries), but also some balsamic hints somewhere in the background. In mouth, the wine was very fruit forward, with gentle tannins and acidity at just OK level. As for animal, vegetable or mineral - mineral, but not fresh stoniness, rather stones covered with mud. I paired the wine with some home made burgers - spicy beef, hot guacamole and rather sweet carmelized onions. The wine was fresh and lively enough to go with hot spices (also thanks to rather low ABV - 12,5%). It was also sweet enough not to go flat and sour against these sweet onions, while fat from the meat softened its already delicate tannins, making the wine even lighter, but revealing no unnecessary acidity. even nicer wine I drank with it. Can't wait for the next lesson! Score: 0 As Ali mentioned, Flatiron had the homework packs so I bought one and we could taste all three. I took Eric\u2019s suggestion and had skirt steak with onions and peppers and served potato leek gratin along side. I was familiar with a white from Gu\u00edmaro so was interested to try a red. The D. Ventura Ribeira Sacra Vi\u00f1a Caneiro had the most inviting aroma. I was surprised to sniff some vanilla along with the briars and fruit. As far animal, vegetable or mineral\u2014- there definitely was an animal with claws but no fur. This was not a mellow wine. For the vegetable the fruit was tart but intriguing with a hint bitter herbs but not unpleasant. And the mineral was there too. This was a wine you could feel in the front of the mouth and also under the tongue, sort of prickly. Score: 1 Sour Guimaro (2014) was not an engaging dinner companion. From my quick, in-store tasting of this month\u2019s 3 RS\u2019s, I felt sure the Guimaro\u2019s sour cherry just needed food to cheer it up. No, it stayed grumpy, and was little changed from sip to dinner (tasting was the \u201915; dinner was the \u201914). On pour, there was that same funky animal nose; throughout, the same creamy/chalky mouthfeel, surprising for so light-bodied a wine and to me, the wine\u2019s best feature; and always that same big, chunky mouthful of sour, sour cherry taste. I like rustic wines, and the Guimaro is that, but with little of the uninhibited charm that often goes hand in hand. It\u2019s sourness is always there. Dinner was a skirt steak with smoky almond sauce tinyurl.com/hl4369r and a side of caramelized parsnip and onion tinyurl.com/zckjkhd . Not a sommelier-ing success. The G was well behaved, if distant, with the steak alone. It got cranky with the sauce. With the parsnips\u2014a vegetable that once did well for me with a sour cherry tasting pinot noir\u2014this time the Guimaro\u2019s sour cherry was just too unyielding. On the plus side, it didn\u2019t clash in a food-sweeter-than-wine way. But neither did it connect, or even nicely contrast. Overall, Barb and I both found the wine It wasn\u2019t rude. But neither was it very friendly. Again, I was looking forward to all three wines after my taste test, and I still look forward to the second two; they seemed quite different. But dinner with the G was less than scintillating. With all due regrets to Wine Scholars in Toronto, San Francisco and other wine-challenged locales, it is my duty to report that New York has now made Wine School almost too easy. Friday afternoon, the upper west side\u2019s 67th St. Wines offered a hustling, bustling, and free and public, Ribeira Sacra Wine School class. No time-in-glass or just-so food pairings; no soulful contemplation or social conviviality. But bing bang boom, in a New York minute I tasted each of this month\u2019s wines. How Big Apple is that? Bottom line, in order of pour\u2026 Guimaro: bitter, chalky, rustic. raspberry fruity and pretty. Decima: peppery, astringent, ethereal, elegant. Liked them all, but after a walk around the block, the Vi\u00f1a Caneiro seemed to be the one I needed extra of. Score: 0 Another spectacular meal with our wine school group in Eugene, OR. The wines didn't knock anybody out. We didn't have a lot to say about them other than they were pleasant and reasonable. Aromas seemed reticent, with some vanilla, strawberry and ham (!). Definitely more animal and vegetal vs. fruit flavors. The wines were smooth and enjoyable, as usual, excellent with cheese. They also paired well with the chicken marbella, braised leeks and mushrooms, and mac and cheese. Worth noting that the Decima Mencia is distributed by Omniwines Distributing Co. in New York/New Jersey. Contacting them directly might make it easier to find the wine in NYC. This was a tough assignment. I live by a world class wine shop here in the San Francisco Bay Area, and could not find anything from this area of Spain. I worked in Madrid for half a year, and don't recall seeing Ribeira Sacra on the store shelves either. I'm going to try looking for this wine in some of the local Tapas restaurants here. They were quite trendy a few years ago, but declining in numbers because so much of the food has to be imported from Spain. Gallicia, where this wine comes from, features a lot of sea food on the table; which is traditionally not a good fit for red wine, and that may be why the vineyards had fallen out of production.

Many of the vineyards, which had been abandoned by the middle of the 20th century, have been reclaimed and rejuvenated.  This is similar to what\u00b4s happening today in Germany, Austria and Italy. We have the Junge Winzer movement (Young Vintners) here. Highly skilled young well educated sons and daughters of well established old vineries - many graduated on wine universities - are taking over and are producing much better qualities than in the past favoured by climate change. This Spanish vintner\u00b4s son Eric has mentioned seems to be of the same kind. Not astonishing because there is a remarkable exchange of students and apprentices across Europe. The difference is that there is a lot of area in Spain and no strong domestic demand so they have to export their increased production. In Middle Europe it\u00b4s the very opposite, so our Junge WInzer have no interest to taking advantage of the global thirst as the Spanish young vintners must have. R egularly production of this New Generation is still small. All investments must be financed by the families so they have to go step-by-step. If you can get what this young generation is producing you should not hesitate as Mr. Asimov has said Yeah, maybe give the octopi a break - heavily over fished I poured a 2012 D.

It\u2019d done well the night before with an Friuli pinot grigio, but by night 2 I was in the mood for a red. The dish seemed more Spanish than Italian, which is what led me to the Ribeira Sacra. It went well. The wine had a chalkiness (mineral) that melded nicely with the pasta\u2019s ricotta base and a strawberry brightness (vegetable) that picked up on the sharp Castelvetrano olives. An unexpectedly lively and fun pairing. It\u2019s a 2011, bought in 2015, and the label is much simpler and more casual than this class\u2019s.

One way to keep from losing your things in to get into the habit of always putting them in the same place. (Schulten, 1) This is such a good idea, I've never even thought of this trick before. Maybe if I try this I wont loose my things. I lose objects everyday. Sometimes I misplace my hair brush, left my retainer in the wrong spot, couldn't find a hair band, and every time I misplace an object I panic while frantically tearing my room apart trying to find the item. One way to keep from losing things is to get in the habit of always putting them in the same place (Mele 1). When I don't put the same object in the same place the object suddenly becomes invisible, I literally can't find it. I lose things all the time. when I lose all my things I tend to find them after I need it. I recently lost my bright yellow headbands,ugly red beats, and plain white charger. Stated in the passage most people lose things then find them after a couple days.(Katherine, pg 1) I can relate to that because last week I needed something but couldn't find it, then 4 days later i found it. I lose things as much as an accident occurs on the roads. Many people can never find things or think they lost something because another person took it. Next time you lose something just look everywhere for it and be careful to not misplace items. I misplace my stuff all the time, but I am getting better at finding them. For example last year I lost my phone a lot and I need help finding it, but now I am a pro. This is my process of finding my phone I would head down stair, make my brother call my phone and follow the sound. The worst part about losing my stuff is that there always in the simplest places or there really in important like a pencil for school. Lot of time it makes me mad when I find them because it right where I left it. Recently I have been getting better at not losing my stuff. For example I would lose a pencil for school every day, but now I only lose one pencil a year. \u201cOne way to keep from losing your things is to get in the habit of all way putting them in the same so I don\u2019t lose my stuff I misplace a lot of stuff i can somehow lose everything that I can be lost. I will lose my pencil, I will drop my phone while looking for my pencil, and I will lose my paper i was working on. When have you recently lost an item that caused you a great deal of trouble to find or replace? ( pg 1 Katherine Schulten) Yesterday I misplaced the lid to a pot I was cooking with and the pot overflow with water and made huge mess. When i was about 12-years-old I lost my phone and i couldn't find it. I can hear it ringing so someone is calling and it was my parents. They got so mad that i miss 10 calls from them each. I don't know why, but I feel like I am always loosing my things. I always loose my phone even though its right next to me, my remote when its under my bed, and something as small as loosing my pencil in my backpack. My parents are always telling me that i would loose my head if it wasn't attached to my body. In the article it says,When trying to find a lost item, such as your keys,don't waste time looking in places you already know the missing object is not. I relate to this article because whenever I loose something I always look in the last places I have been and that is when I usually find whatever I lost. I remember a long time ago I went to the movie theater and I lost a purse I brought. The purse was full of lip gloss and an Mp3 player so whom ever found it scored a music player. Do you lose things often? My dog ran away when I was 7-years-old, I had to chase a baseball that went into a really big bush, I had to garb a basketball that I lost when I was 6-years-old. When have you recently lost an item that caused you a great deal of trouble to find or replace? The last thing I lost was a hair clip that is shaped like a skeleton hand, but I couldn't find it so i tore apart my whole room in search of it. It caused me to make my room a mess, then clean it up, just to make it a mess all over again. The one handed skeleton culprit nearly drove me to the point of crazy. Gone like a thief in the night. No where to be seen - in this sake - holding hair. I wanted that hair clip like a fat kid in a candy store, but i still never found it. I lost and misplace things all the time. It is as constant as going to school. It frustrates me when I lost something and then when I go to look for it I Put down my usb , I put papers on top of it, I walk away, the next day I go to look for it I stomp down the stairs, I lift up the papers, and I find my usb and walk away happy. Score: 1.0 If you don't know where something is, how do you know without looking where it isn't? Score: 0.0 When I misplace things I usually think of what item is associated with the lost item. That though process usually does the trick. I lost a box cutter the other day and had put in in the drawer with the kitchen scissors - I use both things to open mail so - to me they are associated. i lose things every day. i usually sind them the same day. all u gotta do is not be careless Score: 3.0 Where do I begin. I have two kinds of lost things. The first kind are the things that I have put in a perfectly logical place, but then that sense of logic eludes me months or years My passport. Keys that I would not need for a year. Items that I used every day until moving out of the country for two years, such as those perfect salad tongs. I've recovered some of these, but not all. Most of the time this logic will just come, unannounced, and I can just go and retrieve the item (passport, keys) as though I knew where it was all along. Some seem to be gone forever though. The second kind, the daily kind, are those that I literally just had in my hand. Mercifully this has nothing to do with logic\u2014good or bad. I can usually find this kind of lost item by sitting quietly until I can pinpoint where I last had it, and looking around that room (which I have already searched) to see what, exactly, I can't see from where I am looking. The keys are under the envelope I set on my desk when I got the mail; the memory card slipped under the keyboard. I wouldn't think that a pair of gloves could hide a wallet, but hey, there it is! There is probably a third kind too, but I can't remember what it is. Score: 0.0 This is the current culprit of my life. Literally every other day. No sooner do I tuck my wallet under the seat of my car, and I forget where it is. It takes half a day to find it -- more specifically, to remember that I willingly placed it there. And then there's the phone. Apple's Find My Phone has saved me from fruitless searches at least 20 times in the past year alone, I am chagrined to admit. This is not simple forgetfulness; it is side effects of of two meds. Tant pis mais c'est la vie Score: 3.0 This is the experience that sparks the most agony in my life: losing something. Before it is lost, is may be simply misplaced, so I ransack the house, car, office, calling its name. More often, it is an earring, one of the beloved, intricately designed 1940s-'50s rarities I collect select from daily, discovered missing when I reach to remove them upon returning home. And I know in the bottom of my heart that it is GONE. Sinkingly, I can't think how or when it fell off. I have a box of these forlorn remainders, with which I plan some day to glue onto the lid of the wooden keepsake box. But twice lately, I discovered the missing jewelry while out, and immediately circled back and actually found it on the edge of the sidewalk, waiting for me! It's only a decorative gem of commercial artistry. What's remains missing, driving all this repeated panic, was lost in my childhood, my mother. High on a shelf overlooking a room. Deep in a pocket where I hid it, confident that it was safe at last. My lost object is the victim of my own vigilance. Once in a while, as I move from place to place nomadically, someone relieves me of something valuable because I'm not watching over it. I try not to think about it in the aftermath. I lost half of my favorite pair of earrings. They cost five bucks and are irreplaceable. I still have my horse. He's too big to misplace.

Score: 4.0 In an urban white gay male U.S. that seems to have forgotten that there is such a thing as HIV and AIDS, and is also seemingly unaware that there were millions of men who led thwarted, challenging, complex, even secret lives in a U.S. that routinely despised, ostracized and persecuted them because they were queer or fairies, this play is a needed reminder. These men learned to hate their essential selves, to fear retribution for living openly, to despair at and disbelieve in even the possibility of love. Beau has managed to survive, and to hang onto a thread of hope for lasting love, even though a lifetime of experience has taught him otherwise. The insufferable 28 year old Rufus is oblivious to all that Beau has had to endure just to survive, viewing him as an entertaining bibelot of an earlier age. Whether Rufus ever really learns anything from Beau other than Mabel Mercer's song list is left hanging. And whether Beau is affirmed in believing in the impossibility of love, or in the sustained hope for it, isn't resolved. There are no simple answers for Beau. As for Rufus, maybe with age, and experience outside his bubble, he'll learn that there are no simple answers, and indeed that there are myriad questions he needs to learn to ask. A terrific play, and Harvey shines, and Gabriel Ebert does a good job with an essentially unsympathetic role. See it it if you can.

The whole play is talk except for when Sherman runs out of play and dated jokes he adds music, monologues and song - everything but trained seals. The Public over the years has tended to present weak script with social themes and /or for stars that are generally well acted and directed. But the social issue and the star didn't help GENTLY at all. Score: 5.0 You really don't need to remember or have seen Harvey Fierstein before to be blown away by this stunning play. One of the main points of the play is about intergenerational love between two men--its pleasures and pitfalls--which is still a taboo subject in many respects. And the show's allure besides Fierstein's nuanced performance is the razor-sharp script, which is both humorous and heart-wrenching. The ghosts of the AIDS years were never far from mind during the play, and the shout-outs to Judith Peabody and Larry Kramer are crucial moments. This is the play about a late in life gay man navigating a world so different than the one he came of age in that I have been waiting for. It is, quite simply, exquisite.

At the start, the region was in a similar transit crisis, actually worse than today. It was so bad it spurred a bipartisan consensus on two points: That the money needed to put the state's mass transit system back in shape had to be found and that running both agencies could not be left to political hacks. Both efforts were largely successful, although it took billions of dollars and more than a decade of steady civic and bipartisan effort. But then, in the mid-1990s, complacency again set in and the partisan political games resumed. Fiscal gimmicks, deferred maintenance and political appointees again became standard practice.

I note that PATH ridership set new highs and also my own analysis of train alerts and delays show that there are only about 5% or less for Hoboken versus the rest 95% for Midtown Direct on the Morris Line. For years I commuted to jobs and other events in New JERSEY and my Hoboken trains were on time over 95% of the time. This is because there are 24 trains per hour going through the Midtown NY Penn tunnels and if ANY gets delayed the rest all get also backed up. Whereas Hoboken has multiple tracks and no such bottlenecks. Before Morris trains were cut over 25% I used to take a Hoboken Express train in 52 minutes and then could take the PATH to 33rd Street in about 20 minutes Ie Hoboken itself, Jersey City, Bayonne, the Hudson-(Bergen) Lightrail which also has had record ridership. We need transit to New JERSEY not just New YORK! Score: 0 NJ Transit need only focus on two immediate measures: trains on time and seats for all passengers.

Chris Chritie like most of the 'modern GOP hates mass transit, and in fact saw ruining NJ transit as a way to, in his deranged view of things, a way to 'force jobs' to move to NJ. Public transit is one of the reasons the NYC commuting region stayed relatively stable during the fallout from the 2008 meltdown (just talk to people about house prices out of commuting range), and it generates an economic windfall for NJ. The other reason is Christie and his ilk believe that the car is freedom and public transit is somehow communism or whatnot , they live in the 1950's, not the present (just talk to people who work in places like Atlanta what the car brings them..ain't freedom). Christie slashed subsidies to NJ transit, while raising fares ridiculously high, appointed losers to run it who were buddies, and basically figured he would 'kill the beast'. He and his supporters claimed the ARC tunnel was a disaster, but analysis of his arguments before and since show he was lying. It is also telling that when he killed ARC, he then tried to use 500 million in fed dollars on roads..... the ARC could have been modified, to have it connect to the Farley building, but the reality is he didn't want it built, pure and simple, and it was political, not pragmatic.

I used to fly out of Newark Airport because it\u2019s a little cheaper, but I\u2019ve stopped because of the poor service on NJT, not to mention the incredible rudeness of its personnel. First, There\u2019s often a 45-50 minute gap between airport trains during off peak hours, so if your flight isn\u2019t conveniently timed, you\u2019d better take the bus. Second, the last time I used airport service, the train into Manhattan was crowded and passengers were trying to keep their luggage out of the way as best they could. The conductor came in, punched our tickets and announced that luggage would have to go on the overhead racks or we\u2019d have to GET OFF THE TRAIN at the next station. When a lady asked him what to do about her suitcase that was too large to lift and wouldn\u2019t fit on the rack, he said, \u201cWell you\u2019re going to have to get off and take a bus or something because you\u2019re bag\u2019s too big Hey NJT, here\u2019s a newsflash for you: if you\u2019re going to charge people for airport service, you need to provide airport service. And it wouldn\u2019t hurt if you did it with a smile. Turning NJT Rail around will be like trying to turn a loaded oil tanker around quickly. It simply won't happen until: 1) the agency gets permanent and consistent funding for capital projects, and operations; 2) management is treated like humans, and not starved for raises for seven years while the unions get theirs; 3) the agency goes out and hire (or rehires) veteran railroaders to oversee the rail operations; and 4) establish a discipline system where the agency can dismiss employees who do not do their job, or talk on their cell phones while they should be collecting tickets or attending to their duties on the trains.

I am not particularly a fan of the way unions are run and public unions in particular, but the problems with NJ aren't because workers are paid too much, that all the money goes to personnel, that is the lie the GOP has used with much success, ironically especially with blue collar voters. The real problem is Christie cut state funding for NJ (while raising fares to ridiculous levels) during his tenure, and it was deliberate. Christie like many republicans thinks the automobile is freedom, that if he starved NJ Transit companies would move jobs to NJ (which they won't, in part because in NJ to get to jobs you have to drive, on roads that are already choked.

Delays, overcrowding and traffic every day! Score: 0 Katrina, I think I must have seen you standing on the overcrowded bus waiting in traffic at the Lincoln tunnel. In Bergen County there's something on the back burner for NJ transit. It's the plan to extend the Bergen-Hudson light rail into Bergen County.

What is especially galling is money, tons of money paid to connected Wall Street types so they may show the real way to make money. What the State of NJ got instead is failure. Christie's fingerprints are all over the place in the failures of the system, most notably appointing political hacks to run infrastructure that is the foundation of the New Jersey/New York economy and the absurd cancellation of the ARC tunnel in 2010. Take a video of the existing 100+ year-old tunnel and show it to the public. Once people see just how bad things are the political pressure for a new tunnel, or even tunnels, will be enormous.

Some cancers even shrink or disappear on their own. But once cancer is detected, it is impossible to know if it is dangerous, so doctors treat them all. Just something to think about, talk about with your doctor. Insurance companies will often only pay for one mammogram a year. A follow-up after a false positive comes out of women's pocket. After one or two false positives, it becomes too expensive to do this every six months or every year. Been there, done that. You have to take time away from work to come in for a second screening.

Score: 5 Over four years of follow-up, women who had a false positive were significantly more likely to be given diagnoses of late-stage malignancy. The longer the delay in returning to screening, the greater the risk, though the absolute risk remained small. Doesn't this mean that it wasn't a false positive? Score: 12 Early detection results in improved survival of breast cancer is incredibly misleading. Early detection of BC normally means finding DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), which is usually not relevant to health or longevity. Most middle-aged and old women probably have DCIS. But it would never grow or metastasize, and is a normal result of aging. So all of this early detection of DCIS means that healthy women are turned into BC patients unnecessarily. And since they are not sick to begin with they survive really well. Because we have been so indoctrinated about the virtues of screening, few people in the US believe that there is anything wrong with the current regime. But Switzerland is in the process of dismantling all of their BC screening infrastructure because scientific evidence does not support its continuance. Score: 5 Worse than a false positive is a false negative. I'm Stage 4 now. Women with dense breasts need to know that mammograms aren't our buddies. Mine escaped ultrasound detection too. Those who feel a lump in their breasts not detected by imaging should persist until they get a tissue biopsy. Visiting the doctor for anything takes hours and costs money. If you get a false positive, delaying the next visit makes rational sense - why rush into an experience likely to waste more time and money? Score: 9 One issue with false positives is that the resolution -- the process of discovering they're false -- requires follow-up that insurance may not pay for and that may be very costly ($2000-$4000). If you can't afford that, why bother? Score: 6 Yet another reason not to start mammography early, when the risk of false positives is highest. You don't want to be completely burnt-out on the procedure before you reach the age when it stands the best chance of helping you! I'd like to see a similar article about women who have false positives on tests that indicate the possibility of ovarian cancer and who are subjected to abdominal surgery that requires weeks of recovery--not to mention multiple examinations ahead of the surgery and worries about the loss of protective hormones because of the removal of ovaries. I know that you have a maximum of two false positives for ovarian cancer, but just the idea of being screened for something when I have no symptoms has led me to avoid medical checkups. On March 22,2016, I went for a mammogram. I have nothing but good news for you! said my radiologist. On May 24, I found a lump. I waited a day, telling myself my mammogram had been normal, but then decided to embrace what I thought was my hypochondria and get myself checked out again. I'm glad I found out I had cancer THEN an aggressive, but thank goodness SMALL tumor was found, and apparently my radiologist got mixed up the first time around. I have a new radiologist. Score: 5 Trauma? Weirdly, I got a false positive today. I went in and got it checked again. It was not traumatic. It caused some anxiety, then a thrill of relief. I value mammograms even more now because of the thoughts I had before I knew it was a false positive. Score: 13 The reason I didn't go back was money. The annual mammogram was free. But if you are called back - even for something ask or as minor as mine - you have to pay up. The following year I went to a different facility and had my annual done for free. Same for the next 6 times. Nothing showed up again. Score: 2 In the absence of more precise diagnostic tools mammogram is still the only tool available for early detection despite its shortcomings. Especially in the case of aggressive type tumors benefits outweighs the risk. Score: 5 @Anne - Mammography is not the only tool available. Ultrasound works too. Ultrasound picks up some masses that mammography misses, and vice versa. Score: 1 Ultrasound works on dense breasts and is often used in conjunction with a mammogram. MRI is often used for those with dense tissue AND a family history. As someone with dense tissue and cystic breasts, I just wish every visit wasn't so drama-filled. Score: 3 Over the 25 years that I have been getting mammograms I've had many false positives for one reason or another. The anxiety is almost disabling for me now when I go for a mammogram. Yet I continue to go yearly although I have often told myself I would take a year off. Am I just being compliant, doing as my doctor tells me to? I like to think that continuing to go yearly is good for my health. Hopefully the anxiety is worth it. Score: 46 Enough with the trauma or anxiety about false positives on mammograms (and the common followup biopsies of things that turn out to be harmless. It's not just about women's emotions. It's about wasted time, energy, and medical resources; it's about possibly putting one's life and one's family's life on hold for weeks at a time; and about exposure to up to dozens of x-rays and undergoing invasive procedures.

Clothing in, and for, your dreams. Fantastic writing. Score: 2.0 I would be more convinced of her artistry if she did not apply it to clothes, that is, to fashion and the fashion industry walkway. Her clothes may be wild and original, but they don't invite me, personally, to examine them, reflect on them, internalize them as art. I wish she had chosen to be a visual artist, a sculptor, a painter or performance artist, rather than associate her stuff with fashion. If she feels she is entitled to elevate what is actually quite mundane, clothes and wearing them, to art, why not exercise a bit of imagination and originality to designing fantastic table cloths and bed sheets? Score: 5.0 why not exercise a bit of imagination and originality to designing fantastic table cloths and bed sheets? I suppose it's because Ms. Kawabuko is the creator in this case and how she chooses to create and to express her artistic is her own choice. I don't disagree with the merit in some of your points-- I'm not very keen on fashion or how it acts as a medium for artistic expression-- but I also believe calling for artists to do their work in a more accessible way is a bit ironic, as accessible is always relative to whoever is doing the accessing.

Score: 7.0 Although I can't speak for Kawakubo, I would venture to say that she chose the human body as a canvas because her work makes the internal workings of the psyche -- or her interpretation of it -- visible. I would also characterize her clothes as visual art. Score: 1.0 Table cloths? What the heck are they?

Please ask Kawakubo to come out of hiding and give a brief conversation with a sympathetic admirer at the MET or sign copies of the exhibition catalogue. She is much loved. These designs seem like the concept cars of an automobile manufacturer. Both are intended for show only while the utilitarian aspect, either wearing or driving as the case maybe, is wholly absent.

Conte's team mentality is why they might win the EPL this year. Yet, with four games to go they cannot afford to slip. If Tottenham wins all their games, and Chelsea ties two, Tottenham wins on goal differential. While Tottenham is a wonderfully talented and exciting side, they have not shown that they can win on the big stage. They were easily bounced from the Champions and Europa League tournaments, and got beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup at Wembley. Being a Champion is as much psychological as physical.

Kante everywhere? Fabregas/Pedro, making magic on their good days? Willian racing by? There's plenty to see and be bewitched by at Chelsea, regardless of the current rage of admiring their supposed stolidity and seriousness of purpose. But the beauty of the Premier League is that Chelsea are only one of the many stories and teams that anyone would want to watch on their good days. Do many of the teams have bad days?

Citing post-match quotes from defeated managers is bound to elicit underwhelming praise - what would you have them say: Chelsea were more brilliant than us? Yet among neutral fans, glowing plaudits for Conte's Chelsea - after last season's stifled implosion under Jose Mourinho - is almost universal. As they close in on the title, Chelsea are rightly regarded as supremely dynamic, surgical and exciting, and in Eden Hazard celebrate one of the world's most gifted, creative players. And whether or not you believe the Premier League revels in a saloon brawl atmosphere, if you trawled opinion for the one player who you'd most expect to see smashing tables, blindsiding the barman, busting out of jail and making off with the Sheriff's girl in an old-fashioned Western melee, Chelsea top scorer Diego Costa would without doubt head the field. Score: 8.0 Other than Kante, this is mostly the same squad that won the league at a canter just two seasons ago under a different, defensive minded manager. There is nothing to critique. They are pretty easily the best team in the league, full stop. Conte has set Chelsea up to be the best team without the ball & this excellence, in the most part, goes unnoticed. Without the ball they position themselves to control the space and the very quickly transition to attack when back in possession. So simple but so difficult to execute. Score: 1.0 That's very confident of you state that Chelsea WILL win the league. It looks likely, very likely, but Sports and certainties don't necessarily compliment each other.

I've done the job from a clearly defined home office since 2014, and am grateful that my employer has allowed this. Without the daily 35-45 minute commute, without the constant drop-ins, impromptu sheet cake celebrations, bad building air, etc, I've found it to be healthier, more productive and more satisfying overall to work away from the traditional office. What has been asked in return is that I attend meetings in person; so that means a commute to the office a few times a month or as needed and the occasional social function. Piece of cake. Although the odd loads of laundry are done or the technology is terrific, the daylight doesn't quite belong entirely to me. Yes, I save on gas, frequent lunches out and a hefty weekly dry cleaning bill; but this flexibility doesn't necessarily translate to more time with family or freedom to jump in the car and run to the mall mid-week.

And therein lies the beauty: it takes much less discipline to do what you love on your own terms than to commute to an office and have someone else dictate your tasks and hours. THAT takes extreme discipline. There's a difference between teleworking and freelancing. I've been a full time teleworker for almost eight years, but I'm an employee. I can't sleep in or take naps. My time zone is four hours behind my supervisor's. I have to be up and in front of my computer at the same time each morning for conference calls and to keep up with the flow of work that starts while I'm still asleep. From September through March, I am at work before sunrise -- almost four hours before sunrise in December! For me the hardest aspect of my job is that conference calls happen during my most productive hours, leaving the low-energy mid-afternoons (after the east coasters have headed home for the day) for creative or complex work. This is not ideal but I'd have the same problem if I commuted to a local office instead of staying home. My advice is to schedule and take long lunches and get out of the house, or at least out of the room you use for an office. Get some exercise. Telework is not good for that unless you make a point of it -- no steps for a commute, and your bathroom is too close to your office. So fence off time for physical activity, and don't be afraid to pace around, or do some mindless cleaning, while on a call that does not require 100% focus. Finally, instead of trying to replicate a static office workspace, use an adjustable height work surface on wheels, allowing you to find the quietest, or sunniest location in your house as the seasons change. Great suggestions for working from home. Boundaries need to be set for yourself as well, such as getting dressed in something other than PJs and making a point of going out for social occasions.

Taking on too much can be tempting to a freelancer because you don't know whether you'll have any work in 6 months. But this can lead to missed deadlines and/or total burnout.

I found it helpful to set short term goals with other team members. Having a whole week to get something done can lead to 6 days of procrastination, while daily milestones promote more interaction and momentum. The tradeoff is that working from home may not be the best for mid-career people, unless the job is a gig and not a career. Really understanding the organization and building relationships usually requires more than e-mails and conference calls. Off-site workers can be more vulnerable during cutbacks, for the same relationship reasons. Obviously, this is a different issue with gigs.

As the society gets bigger & bigger, we add new levels of representatives; local, county, state, & ultimately national. The Founding Fathers believed that the senior-most representatives in the House should not exceed one for every 30,000 people.

In 1972, Rouge du Pays was renamed Cornalin, creating the present-day confusion. On top of it, I was able to show by DNA profiling that Rouge du Pays is a progeny of two varieties from Aosta Valley (Petit Rouge and Mayolet), and that it is a parent of Cornalin (aka Humagne Rouge).

The liver has multiple drug metabolizing enzymes called CYP that do have genetic variants based on race. CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metabolizers can convert codeine to morphine and tramadol to its more active metabolite in larger quantities than people with usual or poor CYP2D6 function. Morphine is about 6000x more potent than tramadol, so the risk of a hypermetabolizer creating more codeine -> morphine conversions (and thus getting oversedated) is higher than a hypermetabolizer of tramadol -> to its more active metabolite. But tramadol is something more than a pure opioid. It also has neuropathic effects. It is a downstream regulator that reduces pain signals traveling from the spinal cord to the brain (i.e., recognition of pain). It also lowers the seizure threshold and can trigger a seizure in those susceptible (which includes pregnant patients with preeclampsia). Tramadol also will not help people who cannot convert it to the active metabolite (called CYP2D6 poor metabolizers). The same patients also do not benefit from codeine. These two opioids are not useful in the treatment of acute pain. They cause opioid side effects, and have unpredictable effects. It would be safer to use a lower dose of an opioid that is not dependent on drug metabolism (such as morphine). To clarify the genetic variants may be found in different proportions in people of different races but as the Ontario Doctor notes, we are more alike than different - it's just that genetic variation is inherited and as evolution is slow it appears as 'racial differences' that reflect inheritance. Score: 2.0 But there is a test. Tramadol is mostly metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme, and a simple 23andme saliva test will give you enough information that, if run through an SNP conversion website like Genetic Genie, will tell you if you have a mutation on that enzyme that makes you an ultra-rapid metabolizer or not. Additionally, I believe there is some debate about which variation is more dangerous - ultra rapid or slow. My understanding was that ultra-rapid metabolizers were at risk not from build-up, but from the drug working itself too quickly out of the body and thus not doing it's job. With tramadol this wouldn't be a huge problem but with drugs such as clopidogrel which rely on a consistent amount of drug being in the body in order to work, ultra-rapid metabolizers are in grave danger. For tramadol, I would have through the SLOW metabolizers would be in more danger than the fast ones, given that the drug stays way longer in their bodies.

Like Babe Ruth, Jonathan belongs to New York but also like The Babe, he spent his rookie years in Boston, spinning a mix not far removed from what he plays now. It was 1964 and at 20 years old, I was musically lost. Pop, which I had lost all connection to, ruled the airwaves and Folk was,.. well, too folky. Somehow, I discovered Jonathan his first week on WNAC and he soon introduced me to a world of music that has never left me since. Not just singers like Sinatra and bands like Ellington, but an appreciation for the songwriters and arrangers: Harold Arlen, Johnny Mercer, Gil Evans and Quincy Jones, to name a few. Time went by and Jonathan left Fenway for the Bronx, out of my temporal world but the legacy of the musical world he opened my mind to has never left me, he is the mentor I never met.

Score: 1 I have to admit that I am a bit surprised at the inclusion of a Williams Selyem wine in this tasting, given the previously noted exclusion of producers who sell to their customers via mailing lists. Though small quantities here and there will find their way to the retail market, this is not WS' primary business model, which is and always has been through a capped mailing list. What's more, those spare bottles (which I had mostly assumed to be purchased by retailers second hand) are always sold at a fantastic markup, as evidenced by your list price in this article. Perhaps only their single vineyard/estate bottlings are restricted in such a fashion as I described, but the fact remains that the same wine was sold by the winery for about $55. Score: 2 There's a limited selection of Williams Selyem wines available at their sister vineyard, Millbrook Vineyard, in Dutchess County. Also, if you get on their waiting list, you can purchase in their twice yearly allocation and they ship to Millbrook, where they have an enjoyable pickup and tasting weekend.

Wine---it tastes good or it is swill. $59 dollars for wine is not impudent but incredibly cruel. Haughty overtones with a hint of snobbery is my guess. Score: 0 They may not be readily available in NYC, but it is well worth the effort to search out the single-vineyard pinots from Littorai, Williams Selyem and Radio-Coteau. We are lucky to be able to buy them directly. I'm now looking forward to trying the Peay. Score: 2 I don't know what other readers think, but if I'm shelling out $50+ for a bottle of wine, I want that wine to be pretty delicious. None of the wines listed in this review made me want to run out and pick up a bottle ~~ perhaps because not one of the wines was described as delicious. Score: 3 So many opinions. There are plenty of good bottles, even at affordable prices for us mere humans I'd rather drink Burgundy, which is less risky at these prices (btw, burgundy is not cheap, even here in France) Going deeper into Sonoma looking into vineyard specific versions is still really exciting, I think of Nalle, Lynmar, Siduri and Joseph Swan for example that are available for the same or less than most of the wines in this article but yes, not easy to find (unless you go there) Score: 0 Mr Asimov, what do you think about screw-caps versus corks My wife and I greatly enjoy a glass or two of red, especially pinot, with a meal. But, we never consume a whole bottle at one meal so, the remains tend to go south before we consume the whole bottle. We actually shop for screw-cap red wine. It's better to decant the remainder into a half bottle and stopper that. Removing the excess air without replacing it with nitrogen or argon creates a partial vacuum in the bottle, which is filled with VOCs, reducing the fruit in the remaining wine and unbalancing it. Yes DR, we have the stoppers and the device to take air out of the bottle and this process may hold the wine for one more day. When I was in the wine business, our vineyard guys would have favorite sections which they would harvest and ferment in small batches and age the wine in barrels they selected. With all this special handling, I really had to laugh when I saw how they finished - sealed these 750 ml bottles. They used a soda bottle cap as they are simpler to use than a Sanbri corker. After a particularly good tasting, we combined several bottles of left over wine and used my Sanbri to cork finish it. Found those two bottles 2 years later and the wine was still great. Screw caps work great and they are less expensive than cork. Score: 18 My comment is a question: why are California wines so expensive? I very rarely choose them because I can get a better wine and a far better buy from Spain, Italy, and even France, which include import duties and transport. Here in Colorado, Californians are ridiculously priced, which in itself is ridiculous. Score: 0 I'm loving the 2014 Angeline Pinot Noir Reserve. It's under $20, but you can get it on sale for $14.99.

Score: 16 I would be more interested in an article on a tasting of best value Sonoma Coast Pinot Noirs. Score: 5 While the pinot noir grape is favored by the Sonoma coast, the growers and producers are not. As Mr Asimov points out there are many small producers, and their wines are hard to find; which is an understatement. It happens to be a favorite region for me, and mainly for the small family operations that only produce a few barrels. There are few tasting rooms this far from Napa, so you have to develop some strategies to find wines to taste. What most of the small growers in this area try to do, to stay solvent, now, is sell their wine to restaurants. They just have to deal with the wine buyers who want wine with personality for the customers of their high end restaurants, and this is what they have. Each barrel raised like a child; which is why I find Mr Asimov's analogy to the regions of Burgundy so apt. The strategy before was to try to distribute to wine shops in the Bay Area (and beyond). Pouring wine for the shop buyers, and hoping to get a placement. A small shelf slot to start, and maybe a large case order later. The wine is sold on consignment, and has to be retrieved by the wine maker if it isn't sold. I regularly check the online wine menu for restaurants I enjoy, and I will call up the producers I know and ask them which restaurants have their wine, or where it's about to appear. They will be a modest priced offering on the daily chalkboard, but usually of exceptional quality. They sell out fast for that reason. Score: 7 The 20 wines in the tasting were bought at retail outlets from selections available to the public. Sorry to say, this eliminated some of the best producers on the coast, which make small lots of wine that are either snapped up immediately or are available only by mailing list. This included bottles from Kutch, Failla, Anthill Farms, Hirsch, Cobb, Rivers-Marie and Radio-Coteau. A cursory check of Winesearcher lists multiple pages of Kutch, Failla, Anthill, and Cobb wines available at retail among a wide variety of outlets throughout Manhattan, and further afield up the Hudson Valley and out on Long Island. The selection grows exponentially when you widen the search to other states. Seems a shame to have missed these for the tasting when they are so readily available. Score: 3 Proper Sonoma Coast pinot is probably the highest expression of that grape in the states. It's too bad you couldn't include some Radio-Coteau in your tasting, but it's worth noting that the #8 wine, County Line, is effectively the second label of that estate.

Downstairs ahead of the show, I saw the Elephants gathered. I was frozen seeing they were UNCHAINED! In my 50+ years I had never seen unchained elephants grouped at ground level. If those Elephants were mistreated they could never leave them unchained at floor level with women and children milling around. People whose livelihood is working with animals do not mistreat them, especially when in the spotlight of the Greatest Show on Earth. I often hear people mistke that people are something other than animals; they are not. There are only Animals, Vegetables and minerals.

After that it was Super Circus on TV and The Greatest Show On Earth in the movies. The last one was Ringling Bros. about 2008. The animal acts were always the best part of the live shows for me. I wonder if PETA has gone overboard with its zealous causes and that PETA exists mostly to benefits its paid executives? It's not just PETA members who disliked the way the animals were used.

He would not have any better solution to an Iranian nuclear crisis. Trump may hate the Iranian nuclear deal, but he needs it more than it needs him. Regardless of the imposition of sanctions, as long as the State Department is shooting down travel ban hardship waiver requests left and right the Iranian people will assume that the US is not on their side. Secretary Tillerson should immediately direct consular officers at posts processing Iranian visa applicants to apply the undue hardship standard as it was written in the September 24th Presidential Proclamation and approve all visas, pending the appropriate clearances, in which a US citizen is forced to put himself or herself in danger by moving to Iran or there is a compelling humanitarian interest.

What you think is coming to this world when the terrorists take over and the Army is crushed there. World should ask them to dismantle all nuclear devices and bombs or face punishment. Well, you can expect to see more of the 'spontaneous' violent opposition and the expected result is that the government of Iran to use 'force' to quell the outbursts. This first organized violence did not reach deep enough so there will be more testing the patience of the government with the desired outcome that overwhelming force will be identified by the west allowing the only western desired outcome -----the cancelling of our lifting of sanctions. Four more years to go; the only purpose of Prez Trumps election. The JCPOA is working as per the IAEA. If Trump is so concerned about US security ,how come he hasn't enforced the sanctions ,signed into law in August, against Russia for meddling in US elections. This is an example of Trump being Trump. His negotiating style is all bluster and refusal to honor commitments--and willingness to unilaterally tear them up at any time, for any reason, or for no reason. Iran has met the requirements of the agreement. Trump does not care. How has he decided that Iran should develop nuclear weapons (the most likely outcome of unilateral violations of the no nukes deal Iran trustingly chose)? Encouraging Iran to be more belligerent by his actions seems like a poor strategy -- unless your goal is another expensive muddled, forever war. Trump's always negotiate in bad faith business model only works when you can bully the other side--or when the cost of just settling to make him go away is judged to be lower than the cost of enforcing the agreement. When the issue is existential to the other side, his model utterly fails. It also poisons the well for future negotiations with other potential partners. In the end, in his businesses, Trump could only do deals with corrupt banks, kleptocrats and money launderers--or as very limited transactions like licensing deals. Breaking the nuclear deal with Iran would further distance the U.S. from other sentient, advanced, reasonable countries that praise safety and peace...instead of constant violent threats by stupidity personalized in Trump's bizarre behavior. Is there some adult in the room, preventing Trump's impulsive and thoughtless misactions, proper of a 'bully in a china shop'? Could his enablers invent a Russian Monopoly game akin to self-enrichment (money, for a greedy heart)to keep Trump distracted, far away from 'the nuclear button', and close enough to prevent his little hands from reaching whatever little remains in poor people's hands? Trump's rhetoric on the JCPOA is absurd-- he wants bilateral negotiations in a multilateral world, and for the US to back out would make our country look foolish and weak as the other signatories would stand by the agreement, as they and the US should. However, this week of headlines about immigration, and the absolutely disgraceful remarks he made, do give him cover to kick this issue down the road a little further.

If you want to know why Steve Mnuchin is coming out from the White House making threats about the renewal of sanctions on Iran, don\u2019t believe for a minute it has anything to do with terrorism or a popular uprising recently taking place. It\u2019s because those printed sheets of dollars he and his wife posed with won\u2019t cycle into his and his Goldman Sacks buddies\u2019 pockets. Anyone and anything he touches, he worsens. THAT is his Superpower. How to fix Trump AND America : Make Obama President, Again. How frustrating it must be for Trump to see that the whole world (well, minus Israel and its partisans) stands with Obama on this. First, he doesn't know what's in the deal and, second, he couldn't find Iran, with both hands, a map and a Marine rifle squad to help him! Many have asked: If the US pulls out of the Iran deal, will Iran withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? For those who don't know this, BEFORE the Iran deal was reached, Iran was the MOST-INSPECTED country (by the IAEA's nuclear watchdogs) in the history of the world. If the Iran deal gets canceled (which won't happen just because the US pulls out of it, but let's pretend), Iran will still be subject to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and, it's fair to presume, will continue to be the most-inspected country in the history of the world. But what if Iran pulls out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as North Korea did)? If Iran pulls out of the NNPT (which it won't do, but, again, let's pretend), it will be only minutes before US bombers start dropping bombs on Iranian military facilities and the debate begins on whether the bombing should be extended to urban areas such as Tehran (as Alan Dershowitz and others urged several decades ago). In other words, if the Iran deal gets canceled (which, again, won't happen even if the US pulls out, but let's pretend), we'll go back to the status quo ante, with Iran continuing to be the most inspected country in history. Iran DID commit to more in the Iran deal than it had committed to before -- the so-called Additional Protocol, for example, to which other countries (Brazil, for example) haven't committed. That, and other Iranian commitments, are reason to stick with the Iran deal. I'd like news organizations (and everyone else) to reconsider their use of the Iranian nuclear deal.  It is an agreement. But to use deal plays into Trump's mangling of language and conflation of terms. The more we use deal, the more we accept the idea that it is something that can be revisited, tweaked, renegotiated, and even abrogated. Trump conflates the agreement with a deal, and it feeds into his own ends. We are complicit in this thinking when we, too, use deal. It is overwhelmingly in the US interest to act in good faith and sustain this accord so long as Iran continues to act in good faith and comply. US credibility upholding the six party agreement on Iran is also especially important so there is a viable precedent and option for negotiating an international solution to resolve the far more dangerous Korean WMD crisis. The unanswered question is whether Donald J Trump can and will act in the US interest or not. One theory not mentioned, but related to appealing to Trump's base, is that this deal was brokered by Obama, and it is Trumpian to reject and eradicate all things Obama. As a side note, nullifying the nuclear deal with Iran would open the way to war, which Trump needs to divert attention away from the Russia investigations. However the bottom line is that of all the countries in the Middle East it is likely Iran that is most favorable to American values than say Saudi Arabia. We should be helping the people of Iran to modify and come to terms with their government, not supporting the actions of an uninformed President to destabilize the region. Score: 1 Let us all remember that US certification is NOT part of the Iran deal. Only the IAEA can verify if Iran is holding up its end of the deal. US certification is only an INTERNAL concept -- how the President and Congress may decide whether or not we are pleased with the deal. It has no effect on the deal itself. Nobody else cares if the US does not certify. That is just us whining about our feelings amongst ourselves, which we have a right to do. I also want to point out that lots of people in Washington like to throw around this sound byte that This is the worst deal we have ever entered into.  They even go so far as to say it does not go into enough detail. The nuclear deal with Iran is 159 pages long and goes into great detail about Iran's obligations/consequences of their failure to uphold such obligations. Just for reference: the Agreed Framework  we entered into with North Korea to freeze their nuclear program was 4 pages long. Score: 0 So far, the Iran Agreement is about the only thing Trump has not totally screwed up on the world's stage. Between North Korea and Iran, he is ultimately playing with fire. Hopefully, his military advisors can keep his feet and attention span chained to the ground, since these are the two biggest powder kegs that could explode his ego, before containment. Score: 1 The deal gave up US leverage of acting unilaterally against Iran. The Iranians are abiding by the deal. Nikki Haley et al have tried to expand the reach of the deal to strengthen Trump's aggressive designs against Iran. These include Iran to stop activities the US could never get an agreement on which violated Iran's national sovereignty. Score: 8 How much longer will The Donald be able to withstand the pressure imposed by his pal, Bibi? Regardless of what every other country in the world recommends, Israel holds the ultimate veto over Trump's response to events transpiring in the Middle East.

The whole bird is stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, chopped bacon, anchovies, garlic, parsley, thyme and basil, and stoned green olives. The stuffing ingredients are mixed well together with a beaten egg, salt and pepper. After stuffing the chicken, the authors suggest putting in a peeled onion, to stop the stuffing escaping, before sewing the chicken up. The chicken is then placed in a pot that will just hold it, with a tight fitting lid. The chicken legs are severed at the joint so they don't push the lid off. Around the chicken put in a peeled onion, two carrots sliced lengthwise, a stick of celery, a bouquet garni. Then pour in enough milk to cover the chicken. Place two bacon rashers over the breast. Cover the pan with the lid, and set a heavy weight on the lid. Bring to a bare simmer, and simmer for three hours. Allow the chicken to cool completely in the milk, then remove it, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold the next day. The milk stock can be used as a soup base.

I really like them and how creative the people and the artists can get while they are designing them. I say when you are planning to get a tattoo you have to remember to think about what you are getting, make sure you will want it for a long time, and if the drawing doesn\u2019t look wright or if it\u2019s not what you want speak up. Tattoos are supposed to be works of art to express people's feelings and likes/dislikes. Anyone can pick whatever design they want. In my opinion I don't want any tattoos when I am an 18-year-old because I don't find any interest in putting tattoos on my body. Both my parents have tattoos that signify different and important things. Tattoos are like a piece of art in a museum in my opinion. Tattoos are a work of art. Personally i want a lot of tattoos. I wold like to get something to represent a time in my life that shows who i am. Tattoos are like an amazing art piece that you get to design. When i turn eighteen i am going to design a tattoo, get a tattoo, and show it to everybody. I believe tattoos are amazing ways for one to express them self; the possibilities are endless. Tattoos can range from silly pictures and words, to deep and meaningful ways to portray a deep connection and love to something close to you. Tattoos are often symbolic, and carry a deep meaning with them. At the end of the day, the person who is getting the tattoo is getting it solely for them self, and anyone else truly does not have the right to judge so harshly. The stereotype that goes along with people who have tattoos is also sad, for my brother and dad both have tattoos and are two of the nicest people you could hope to meet. If I love something as much as I would need to get a tattoo, I would absolutely get one. I think that tattoos are pretty cool. I believe tattoos are okay if they had a really good meaning. If it didn't have any importance, it would be a big waste of money. Some jobs want you to be professional, and tattoos aren't the way to go. Sometimes people express themselves in tattoos that tell stories. I honestly probably would get a tattoo even if they are very painful. I would get a small tattoo, so it could be easily hidden. However, I would not get a whole sleeve. I think tattoos are pretty cool. I myself personally really like tattoos and plan on getting some in the future. I don't think anything is wrong with getting tattoos because one its your own body. You can do anything you want to it because its yours. And two because they are symbolic. Some people get tattoos just to look cool or tough. Others get tattoos because they represent something. The majority of my family has tattoos, and they obviously don't see anything wrong with them either. The only problem with tattoos is that if you get one, you need to be 100% sure in what you want to have a good tattoo artist. Tattoos are permanent, unless you want to drive to a tattoo removal place, pay a fortune, and get it painfully removed. Which i don't think anyone would enjoy doing. So you need to be careful. There's nothing wrong with tattoos, as long as they really mean something to you. Every tattoo is different, usually the tattoos are spin-chilling and creepy like with skulls and swords. I feel that tattooing is very painful and if I was to ever get a tattoo then I would take lots of pain medicine because I hear that it hurts like a bull ramming into you by the horns. I really like this tattoo because it has an eagle and the statue of liberty witch shows self-respect and that he probably severed our country at one point. If I was to get a tattoo I would get a full sleeve tattoo, but also at the same time when i see people with full sleeve tattoos I kind of judge a book by its cover and think there a bad person even if there not. My dad has tattoos and I think they look cool, but I would never get one. I think they look cool but what if you need to look serious or a job you want won\u2019t let you have tattoos. I really like them worth look cool or cute to lose opportunities. It works for some people but it wouldn't work for me. What happens when you get old and your skin gets all stretchy your tattoos will be ruined and look like garbage. I think they are painful, a waste of money, they eventually fade and look bad. Tattoos are not all that horrible. A lot of people use tattoos to express themselves, or have a piece of memory attached to them. Tattoos are symbolic and they can tell a story. Although, i would never get a tattoo, I don't have anything against it. I always viewed tattoos as a piece of art and your skin is a canvas. However there are some disadvantages to getting a tattoo. For example getting a job, or when your skin starts to sag, anything like that. Other than that if you want a tattoo go ahead you do you, its your body, its a canvas waited to be painted. Tattoos are not all that horrible. I don't think tattoos are my thing. Although I do think the process of getting a tattoo is cool. Going to the tattoo shop, getting a piece of art placed on your body, even though it fades into a green blob over time. Most of the careers that are successful don't involve a color-filled sleeve of a dragon wrapped around your arm. Meaning, if you want to succeed in life, getting ink'd up isn't the smartest choice. I believe that tattoos are a way to express yourself, and in other ways tattoos have a lot of meaning, so I really do like the idea of tattoos. I think that the tattoo in the picture shown is an amazing piece of art. Although they can be very painful I would love to get a tattoo some day. I would get a tattoo that represented my parents in some sort of way. When I get one I wouldn't get one too big but big enough that it can still be seen and I don't want to get it in color I would like it in black and white, because personally I like tattoos better that way. I believe that tattoos are a way to express yourself. I do not personally like tattoos although they can look cool on some people. Tattoos allow people to represent who they are, the way they want to live, and to express how they feel about what their tattoo is. Tattoos getting done by super-star artists with unique style is definitely the way to go. Personally, I think tattoos are a great way to show off an artist's talent, and to add something colorful to your body. The only thing you need to caution is where, and who you get it done by. Getting it done by a cheap, low-grade artist is something that is very common, and other's may not know the consequences of getting a tattoo that doesn't look good at all. The tattoo in this picture to me is a beautifully done piece of art. The color and symmetry of the lines on the back make the whole tattoo a 10/10. This showed off the artist's talent to the max. I don't really like tattoos. I know people with tattoos and they think they are like being in heaven. Tattoos are one of the things I wont get but i'm okay with people that have a couple of tattoos. People who have a lot I think they have skin cancer. tattoos are a way to express themselves but they are one of the many ways to get a skin cancer. Tattoos are like a great pain in your arm. I believe tattoos are a great way to express yourself. Most people get a tattoo that has a deep personal connection to them which i think is awesome. Though, tattoos are a big commitment, if you really like the design they are very amazing. People must make sure the tattoo artist knows exactly what the costumer wants. Someone could want a certain design and it could end up looking like the complete opposite of what they wanted. The tattoos in they picture and very interesting and look somewhat realistic-looking. I would like the get six tally marks and a moon to represent that certain people that changed my life. I don't think anything is wrong with getting tattoos because one;its your own body. You can do anything you want to it because its yours. Some people get tattoos just to look cool or tough. Others get tattoos because they represent something. My grandpa was an Air Force pilot and he got his rank tattooed onto his arm. The only problem with tattoos is that if you get one, you need to be positive in what you want to have a good tattoo artist. Tattoos are permanent, unless you want to drive to a tattoo removal place, pay a bunch of money, and get electrified. Which i don't think anyone wants to. So you need to be careful. There's nothing wrong with tattoos, as long as they're symbolic. My thoughts on tattoos is that you should only get it if you really want to. Don't let any of your friends make or bribe you because its permanently there for a really long time maybe your whole life. If I were to get a tattoo i would get on my left wrist love spell in curves with dot dropping from the word forming into a butterfly. the colors that i would want for it would be blue, purple, and black. I have always want this tattoo since I was 10-years-old. Only get a tattoo if it has meaning to you. When I was first born my dad went and got a tattoo of my name on his right shoulder. So before getting a tattoo really think about so you don't make a permanent mistake that can last the rest of your life. I feel tattoos express who you are, their another way of showing emotion of feeling. In my opinion tattoos are important they tell a story, not all of them have to have a meaning for me. It all depends on you and how you see tattoo if you believe their great for emotion or horrible ruining you body. I understand why people would hate tattoos because its technically body modification,but i personally think their great to cover up flaws and express yourself. Tattoos are like mystical creatures that come to life on your body. The tattoo in the photo is fantastic, it tells its own story quietly. Its whispering the events that occurred in its life time. I would love to tattoo myself. I've always been really into tattooing, ever since i was younger. I have a couple of things i already know i'm getting for sure. I'm definitely getting a dream catcher on a part of my body for personal reasons. i'm also getting a matching tattoo with my mom because we're really close. I feel tattoos express who you are, their another way of showing emotion and feeling. I don't really like tattoos. I know people who have them and there's a lot of pain which can't be good for your skin to prick it with needles. Then there's the ink and it going through your skin into your bloodstream, this can't be good either. Plus I don't need to have people look at me. I'm ok with me the way I am. Plus I would much rather see the art on my walls than on my body, that way it will always look beautiful instead of sagging on a wrinkly body as I get old. Plus people change. I used to have a favorite color in elementary school and now I don't like that color anymore. Imagine if I had it permanently stuck to my body? I think if you like tattoos you should get one as long as there is a good meaning to it. Like, if someone has died that was a big part of your life, many people will get tattoos that are related to that person Although I don't think people should be getting tattoos of their boyfriend/girlfriend because who knows how long you'll be together. As long as you like it i think its fine, but make sure you like it before its permanent, but they don't always turn out the way you want it to look. A moon tattoo might end up looking like a dysfunctional banana. I would like a tattoo but i don't know what I would like it to be though , I do know I don't want it to always be looking at me like look-away-or-else. I believe that getting tattoos is an OK thing in life but you should not like cover your whole body that's just bad for your skin and for people looking at you. But yes i will get some tattoos on my body but i wont cover my body i will just get some on my arms or my chest. getting at tattoo is like coloring yourself with a very permanent marker. No doubt that the tattooing is historically a global phenomena that has been embraced significantly by all the cultures and tribes across the world's spots. As it states in the article, since its advent and emergence in Egyptian civilization until it prevailed and gained a dramatic popularity in this era, it has been adapted for a plenty of purposes and varied among societies in terms of the extent of painting, where the tattooing would be, and the portrait tattoo depicts. However, as the trend and our world keep changing, the reasons people have using tattoos have changed increasingly by the majority of people, meanwhile, surprisingly it has changed slightly among people who still live in villages and remote areas. For instance, here in Saudi Arabia, the bunch of tribes across the Saudi borders still adhering to tattoo as a kind of tradition that represents both tribal identity and a feminine beauty and aesthetic. Moreover, as I remember correctly, the tattoos are extremely tiny and spherical that located at bottom of chain which has been described constantly for millennia as a kind of refined and elegant element for humankind. After the tattooing has been revered for centuries across the world, I'm of the opinion that tattooing in this era has been disgustingly abused and has shaped further a negative feedback from people around the world. The way and shape the tattoos painted on body by the proportion of people honestly evokes a kind of scary and tedious feelings."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Keywords: Snippet: What can be learned when young and old mentor each other? Score: 0.0 In my opinion, learning is a choice that everyone has. With technology becoming such an integral part of our lives now information is now easily accessible with a few clicks. There are some things that can't be taught by using the internet. It requires a life-long exposure to that certain skill or action. For example, if we look at the phones we can see that usually younger people are much more knowledgeable when it comes to the phones. This is because they have been exposed to an era in the world where technology has become a society standard. I find myself sometimes puzzled by certain aspects of life and the answer usually can be found in an imaginative, interested, and young adult. With technology becoming more prevalent in our lives we might find that younger and younger people will have a bigger role in society In my opinion I think that everyone have the opportunity to learn, wherever they want to, it doesn\u2019t matter the age, because we are here to learn. Usually when I come back to my country I have to help my grandmother with the social networks, how to use it and how to develop it. She learn so fast is like the way of her entertainment because now she have facebook and whatsapp and all the time she is calling me and send me picture that I posted. It is a good manner to have good communication and know that they are okay. Every day we can learn something new from people that you never imagine, my cousin just have 10 years old and she teaches me every day how to pronounce some words in English . I think the years that you have don\u2019t involve in the learning or teaching because the only thing that we take at the end is the knowledge. It is very important to learn from a younger person and an older person because they can teach different things. Such as for my own experience, I learned a lot of things from younger people such as they didn\u2019t teach me to lie, a little more information they show me love, respect, and share with other people. Taught to older people,I shown them how to use a cell phone,a computer as such do a research on the internet. It is amazing for me to talk with older people because they have more experience that and they can help me to do less mistakes that can do in my life. I have learned many skills from younger and older people and I have taught them many skills too. I have a fifteen-year-old brother and I have learned how to fix my laptop from him. He knows a lot about computer systems. For example, when my laptop breaks down I call him and he tells me how I can solve the problem. Nowadays technology is a very useful tool, but old people get confused when they try to use a smart phone or a computer. My boss always gets in trouble with his phone, so I always tell him what he has to do. I taught him how to use a phone app with which he can see the cameras from the grocery store. I taught an older person how to co-operate, behave, unity of command and customer services in the line of business because that is one of the basic step in business. The fact is in modern business world it\u2019s basic that you must meet with difference ages of people and the most important things is using the meaningful and reasonable way in other to achieve your personnel or organization objectives. Moreover, it will be very useful and a thing of joy to teach someone that is older them you. In life it\u2019s very common to help the elderly. In my country many people didn\u2019t go to school because most of them work in farms, so when they go to public places like hospitals they can\u2019t read the signs so I help them to read and show them where to go. I have asked my neighbor child many times to help me if I have problem in my computer. Life is based on experiences; I think that the older you are the wiser you are. Young people need to listen to older people. They had faced and learned many things because of their experiences. Everybody makes mistakes and why not learns from those and the ones who had made more are older people. They also need help with the technology and languages. As young people we are more flexible to acquire and use the new technology and that is how we can help them and teach them how to use it. I t is very important to speak about \u201cWhat Have You Learn From a Young Person \u2026 And What Have You Taught An Old Person. I have been working with my young friend since July 2015.I have learned a lot of things from him. He taught me a lot of things about life in United States. He helped me to have a good pronunciation in English. When I speak with him about something he always encourages me to speak English because he tells me all the times \u201c Onevil you speak good English because I understand you. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that, because before when I used to speak with someone .I thought nobody could understand me. I have learned a lot of thing s about him. He taught me Grammar, Pronunciation and accent. Now days old people with computers too. I like working with my team workers. I help old people to improve their skills computer. Older people have many experience and knowledge. We have learned a lot from them, but in this there is new technology and young people have more knowledge and skills about it, in some topics, the young people became in the teacher`s roll for adults. For example now the technology is fundamental and necessary. Young people and kids have much knowledge about computers, internet, smart phones, apps and languages. Young people are very interested and every day they learn more about these. It seems that they born with that knowledge. I have learned many things from my kids, they teach me about technology, internet also English. My kids have skills and they share all that they learned in their schools. And also I have taught to older people how to use the computers, sign into social media and buy online. I teach them what that they need to learned, I share with my mom or others adults what my kids have taught me. Maturity comes with experience not age. We can learn lot of things from older people. It\u2019s a big thing to learn from younger people. I have some of my younger cousin\u2019s, they help me a lot. They were born here. When I can\u2019t understand anything about my study, they help me all the time. I\u2019m not feeling uncomfortable or shy because learning is a big thing, it doesn\u2019t matter if they are younger or older. Their brain is working so fast more than older people. I always try to learn good things from younger and older people. I want to teach them too. Example, my mother didn\u2019t use Facebook before. She couldn\u2019t understand how to use it. Most of my family members use social media. It\u2019s a source of connect to each other. Even though, when we getting bore, it could be help us. My mother told me that she wanted to create a Facebook profile. I think that she needs it. I helped her to create account and taught her how to use it. Now she knows how to use it. I believe that learning good things from anyone, it could be helpful for our life. According to the topic of the article, I have helped people with his or her phone or computer and I taught them many times how to use it, such as my mom, her friends, my aunt, my grandma etc. I have not learned yet anything from people younger than me. I am sure I will have many opportunities to learn many things also I love to learn everything that I can. A great deal of old people has taught many things for my personal, economic, academic and love life. Every advice and teaching that I learned, I try to put in practice for my life. I also have taught old people especially people around me some things, such as do no litter. When we do something without expecting something in return, we start making a difference in anything. I could empathize with Ms. Korkki while she learned how to use snap because most of the older people don\u2019t use as much smartphones. The older people have a wiser brain and it complicate to learned something new. However, she is the one who progressing herself to learned about a new technology. It takes her an inordinate amount of time to learned the fundamentals of snap chat. She asks for help to Talya to teach her about the Snap chat. She feels awkward in the beginning because she is asking for help, particularly from young lady. But she knows that learning new things can keep it in top working order. Later she doesn\u2019t feel any awkward to ask help from younger age. I think older people and younger people should help each other and share their ideas because these can help them improve their relationships and older people can recognize that they can ask help for younger people without feeling any awkward. I helped my grandmother to use her cellphone because she didn\u2019t know how to use it. I taught her all functions of her cellphone and she didn\u2019t feel any unpleasant to ask help for me. Now she can use her cellphone way better than before. Also, she has felt happy that I helped her. Learning does not depend of your ages. I have learned from younger and older people. When I was 16 years old, I did not have skills to play soccer. A neighbor about 9 years old taught me how gets basic skills. I was not surprised because I had always known that kids can teach us many lessons. When someone helps me, I try to share my knowledge with them. In that way we can get better results. Technology has revolutionized the world and younger people have become expert in this field, maybe because they were born in the technological era. I think that most of children have ever taught their parents about technology. In my own experience, I have taught my mother how to use her smartphone, how to use Facebook and whatsapp. She always asks me for help. However, my five year old son knows more about computers and smartphone than me. Every person is different; therefore everybody has a particular way to learn. Technology has been changing constantly during the last years, it does not stop, and nevertheless many and old people don\u2019t know much about it. It happens with all in the world. People have a different environment and it is a thing that can define if you want to learn or not. I remember when I got my first job. My partner gave to me the instructions and I learned quickly, for me it was easy despite being nervous. My another partner did not believe in me because she thought that I was too younger and she wanted that her friend took the job, she only gave me 2 days per week and I needed 3 days. Two months late her friend did something wrong and now I have one year in my job. I think that some people think that \u201cI have all my life in this work and I know everything\u201d this is a wrong because we don\u2019t know everything. Each day I try to know more. My coworker that believes in me is older than me. She learns from me and I learn from her because our minds are open to a new things. There is a saying that I like so much \u201cThings that we know are like a water drop and things that we ignore are like a tremendous ocean\u201d While I lived with my mother and my aunt I definitely was their cellphone\u2019s technician, even though I don\u2019t consider myself much of a pro in the subject. I would teach them the basic things I know, not because I\u2019m smarter than they are, but because of the moment in history I was born on. For them, otherwise, I was a master on it. I think that as adults, we learn things that we\u2019ve forgotten at some point from younger people. I\u2019ve seen in many kids half my age a sincere naturalness while speaking their mind out that I\u2019ve left behind some time ago. Even if it\u2019s hard to accept help from younger people because it hurts our ego a little bit, we have to recognize that we didn\u2019t come to the world as complete creatures. As humans, we are always learning from different sources, so we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed or ashamed of obtaining knowledge whatever the source is. As humans every day is a learning process and we learn something new each day from young and old people. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned and always seen in children is they forgive faster than adults. When I scold my friend\u2019s daughter h is 1 +, 2 seconds later she is all over me, that\u2019s why I said kids forgive easily. I don\u2019t keep grudges against anyone regardless of whatever they did to me. I forgive people without them apologizing to me. I think everyone can learn from everywhere or anyone , I do not think learning has something to do with age , you could be 17 years old and have had many experiences , or 81 and have never experienced nothing new so you do not have nothing to tell about . I have helped many elderlies with technology because is well known that we, the young generation, have the knowledge about it. There have also been times when I do not really know how something works for example, a computer, I do better with phones. Surprisingly an older person has helped me out with it. I have a 13 year old cousin, and I have only known her for 6 months so far , I had never talked with her or even seen her before that. I can say that sometimes she is inclusive more mature than me in certain situations, that is something that has always amazed me. Is so good to know someone like her. Even with technology she can go as someone my age. I feel proud of her. Angie Blanco In my opinion, I think that the world is changing very fast and the people who will understand how it will work are the young people because they will be the first who will understand these changes. In my own experience, I always help my father with technologies that he really doesn\u2019t understand. He also tries to learn how it works, but he always needs help to make sure for a good work. The young people are become smarter than the old people. We should have more respect for these people. Well, I like to teach to older people what I know about technology. When my older friends have a problem with their telephones, they came to my home because sometimes I am able to fix problem. I know many things about technology and I like to teach to older people when they are confused with how to use a computer or a telephone. From a younger friend I learned some Magic Tricks that he taught me. When younger and older friends taught me something, I usually only say \u201cthanks\u201d but I never offer anything to them. I have one younger sibling and i have learned that they can teach you lie skills. Siblings teach you how to work together with each other, patients to not yell or fight, and how to love family. I feel like when you learn things from older people you learn through their experiences instead of your own experiences. It is also harder to teach older people new things too. They always have a belief that they already know what you' re trying to teach them. Korkki even states The older brain is a wiser brain, he said. I do have a younger sibling, and all three of them teach me new things all the time. They probably teach me more than I teach them. I was helped by experienced elders who taught me the ropes. My elders have raised me to who I am today, how I race motocross, and how I live life. Although, some of the people I learn from are impatient-looking, I still take their advice."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

I think sometimes internet can\u2019t reach all of word. In book dictionary, it has all correct word. But it\u2019s little bit difficult to find word. But we can find the correct word from the book dictionary. But I think that we don\u2019t always need to use dictionary. It makes us dependable. So we have to use our mind first, if we can\u2019t understand than we can use dictionary. I used to look for and find the meaning of unfamiliar word, in a dictionary. When I was a child. During my high school, I used to listen in the class, when our teachers were teaching us. Sometime, I asked my brothers who was in the university, whenever, I don\u2019t understand a word that\u2019s unfamiliar to me but, nowadays, I have many ways of finding unfamiliar, like, goggle, dictionary, come to class and listen to our teacher whileI used to look for and find the meaning of unfamiliar word, in a dictionary.

I go to find the meaning of words in a Dictionary or an intermittently online (App). Nowadays generations are changing, and peoples have been using more app often which refers definition of words. App doesn\u2019t take enough time to look up and it has many unfamiliar words which you can discover them in app. It has changed overtime because various websites or apps have a different ways of meaning of definition to explain the readers. The last word I looked up the meaning was pugnacious. It means ready to fight or to arguing very forcefully. I saw this word in articles and look up in app. In addition, I look up the meaning of unfamiliar word is frequently because sometimes you require the definition of these words to understand the concept of a reading or speech. When I need to find any word that I really do not understand, I usually use a dictionary book. But sometimes I do not find the word that I need to know, so I use my phone because I have a dictionary app there. I do not use often the dictionary because I try to learn for myself the meanings but when I am confused I use it. I agree, the dictionary says the true all the time. When nobody understands something the first thing they think is about the dictionary. I think that schools need to teach the young students how use the dictionary when they are confuse, because sometimes they use the internet and usually the words have different meanings. The last word that I looked up was gambling that means a person who plays with money to win more money and other similar things. The first time that I looked for this word was in the Charlie Chaplin movie. Find the meaning of unfamiliar words is very important, when we are writing something such as an essay, letters, documents, and other kind of papers. We have to be sure how to express ourselves in that writhing. When I was ten year old and I did not understand the meaning of one word I used to use or find it in the dictionary and highlanders, and then the next time that I see that word I already know the meaning, but now as I learning language students frequently I used to use the dictionary and help me to understand the unfamiliar word, that\u2019s why is very important to keep learning every day, and keep your brain open for new words and new meanings. I have to admit I don\u2019t like that much to search for meanings in the dictionary. Most of the time I don\u2019t search for them because by the time I get to determinate the appropriate meaning, I\u2019ve lost the idea of the sentence I was reading. I first try to find myself a meaning for the word through the context of the sentence. Also if I consider that the word is not essential to understand the text, I just leave it behind. Definitely, this is not the right thing to do To search for words in the dictionary makes our lexicon bigger, allowing us to discover an entire new world, and to know how to name something in different ways makes us more fluent while talking and writing. Very often we forget these new words very quickly. We should find a way to illustrate meanings in our minds and connect it with certain memories, so anytime we see these words again we\u2019ll be able to remember the full meaning. Nowadays is too easy to find the meaning of an unfamiliar word. Many people use the short way and one of the most used is the internet that has provided much information for us and it helps us to it faster than ever. When we see an unfamiliar word we try to find the meaning in virtual dictionaries that had been helpful. The dictionaries used to be the main provider of meanings but it take too much time to find those and now we don\u2019t have that much. When I don\u2019t know a word I usually Google it but when I was a child I used to ask to the teachers or an old man, they could know more than a young men. There are many ways to learn about meanings of words. We always need a dictionary for the searchof words. Sometimes we can no trust all of them, because they have different meaning that makes us confuse. Often we look up the meanings of unfamillar words. There are a lot of questions about, what is the true? We have to be careful when we use the internet. It will be better to use the dictionary than the web. I usually find meaning in the web because I think is easier. You can say that I am lazy. I used to spend three or two minutes before I could find the word I was looking for in my mom\u2019s dictionary, and I think that in the web we can find some sort of meanings that we would not find casually in a regular dictionary, now if you ask me how often I look for unknown words I would say that most of time my laziness comes to me and do not let me improve my vocabulary even if I have a dictionary in front of me I would rather use my logic to figure out the meaning of what I was looking for . I do agree with Jesse Sheidlower\u2019s idea because nowadays we can doubt about everything we already know, my advice for all of those looking for responses and explanations is to get a highlighter, a dictionary or your phone (it does not really matter as long as you get to your goal) and do not give up on your search, keep searching, keep learning. That is the point. The last word I looked for was \u201cWordsmith\u201d I saw it on this article and it means the person who works with words. I used to use my phone to look up for the meaning of words which I didn\u2019t know. it\u2019s useful to have a better idea about the meaning and I can learn the verb and the noun of words. Many problems happen when people are trying to find the meaning of a word. They would get a dictionary for find the correct definition. If we have access to internet then, we can search it on Google or any other internet search. When I was a child, I used to use my Dictionary to find the definition of every word that I didn\u2019t understand, but now with my smartphone, I can find any definition on internet. Also, many of these definitions are wrong because the internet have a lot of information from many different ideas about one thing. We need to be carefully with what we are looking for because internet is not the best solution for everything, it is just a help another way for search new words. Find the meaning of a new word it helps yourself. Twenty years ago to find the meaning of a new word was in a book dictionary. Today we can find it online. Now it is a little bit easier than before. It is important for people to get to know every word that they hear. Sometimes I look up in Wikipedia. I know a very good online dictionary named wordweferences.com. There you can find the meaning, form and use of lots words. Time is changing and we must be adapted. Technology is a double-edged sword. It can help us and can make us a person without own knowledge. While I was growing up I used to use the dictionary to look up words that I come across We are in the 21st century, where everything we do involves technology. I use a dictionary app on my phone to look up words now. It\u2019s more convenient than carrying the dictionary around. I prefer the dictionary app, because it also pronounces the words for you in case you don\u2019t know how to pronounce them. When someone is trying to find the meaning of a word they would go get a dictionary. If you have access to internet then you could search it up on google or any other search engine. When I was about 7-years-old I used to use a Dictionary but as I got older I got my first phone it was a blue and black flip phone.

Why does a female-centered movie need to be about empowering women? Why can't it just be about people, which is what women and men are before they're compared with anything or anyone else? Score: 1.0 It's interesting that the reviewer arrives with the assumption that since this is a female-centered movie, the women's roles must be empowering. If movies that enter this territory are judged by whether they are sufficiently inspirational, then it is no wonder that they do not always deliver surprises.

Each march had its celebrities -- sadly, I watched Janis Joplin's last performance.

Ray would later go to Pine Ridge to try and help out with the siege, the same one the entrapped Leonard Pelletier. Ray was murdered, a killing still unsolved.

Score: 5 I was a journalism major at American University in Washington D.C. in 1968, and doing an internship at NBC News. I spent many hours with reporters at Resurrection City - it was an inspiring place and I learned much from the many heartfelt orations at the Poor People's Campaign. Those were different, kinder times where a feeling of civic duty and helping poor people was evident. It is sad that we have devolved since then to the age of Trumpism and Oligarchy. Score: 3 I was living in Washington DC at the time, the new bride of an Army enlisted soldier. We watched while that lovely piece of land became a swamp, violent and dangerous. It had been a ridiculous idea and doomed to failure - no organization, no discipline - just a mess. We moved to DC in Sept 1966, and left when my husband completed his tour of duty right after Thanksgiving in 1968. We watched from the roof garden of our apt building in SW Washington, while DC burned, after the assassination of Dr King. I was working at the National War Ollege at the time - gates and fences barricaded, helicopters taking off from the parade grounds. VP Humphrey lived in our apt complex and we awoke one morning to see Marines with fixed bayonets patrolling the perimeter of the complex. Seeing ranks in DuPont Circle is a sight I'll never forget. We were there during the March on the Pentagon - we went, not to demonstrate, but to see firsthand what was happening and compare to media reports.

My mom and dad took me to Resurrection City so I could play whiffle ball and such with the young kids that were there with their parents.

Education in today's America is no longer about producing an educated adult. It's about checking a student's gender before they use the bathroom in order to single out and embarrass a transgender child. It's about refusing to teach children about evolution. It's about seeing to it that children never learn words that are offensive even if those words have a legitimate place in books that are part of American literature. It's about not telling children how their bodies work, about sexuality, etc. American education, on both sides, has become an exercise in not offending anyone, not forcing students or teachers to confront the issues of the day or the past, and making sure that no one learns critical thinking while in school. Rote memorization, teaching to the tests, and blaming teachers and teachers unions are more important than education. Students civil rights don't matter here. On the one hand, there is a disturbing trend in this administration's appointments -- an EPA chief who is opposed to protecting the environment, a Secretary of Education who has worked to undermine public schools, and so on. On the other hand, I am reluctant to brand Mr. Muniz with the possible sins of one of his clients. The respectful statements of Mr. Muniz's opposing counsel in that case, noting Mr. Muniz's professionalism, are important. Our legal system is based upon the principle that accusations, civil or criminal, are not verdicts. We believe that zealous but honest and professional advocacy on both sides will help bring out the truth. Full disclosure: I am sensitive to this issue because I am a lawyer myself. I have been fortunate not to have represented a high profile client on the wrong side of conduct as distasteful as that allegedly done by Florida State.

Our institutions are only ever as strong as their occupants' and the people's will to uphold them. We must stand against willful ignorance and the kangaroo government being constructed here. Why would we want a person who does not know truth or reality from a paper bag to be influencing education policy?! As a former criminal defense lawyer, k-12 and now university level educator and as a parent/ grandparent, I believe one of the most important tasks the US government has is to ensure all 50 states provide a good education to our nation's populous.

I just hope that Trump does one good thing amongst all the carnage and clamps down on colleges that have become little Liberal dystopias where every man is a rapist (or at least 1/4 of men) and every Halloween costume is an mortal insult. Personally, I think shutting down this Office of Civil Rights at the education department would have been more efficient and helpful but at least selecting admins who will limit this overreach is a start.

Ruggles and Douglass both fought for civil rights in public transportation challenging discriminatory practices for stage coaches, ferry boats and railroad trains.

Keywords: News and News Media; Reading and Writing Skills (Education) Snippet: What might be lost, or gained, when students and teachers work under daily camera surveillance? Score: 0.0 Classroom surveillance, as in China, will make both students and teachers act differently, especially when parents and other teachers have the opportunity to make comments about their ongoing actions. Students might act more well behaved since they know they are being surveilled, and the same goes for teachers. Each teacher has different teaching styles, and when being watched and critiqued, they might lose said personality and become almost robot like. These changes are not necessarily an improving change because people learn and teach differently. The individuality of students, teachers, and classrooms are at the risk of being lost. Teachers become scared of what they say or how they tech a certain topic because someone's always watching. I have not personally experienced my classroom being live streamed and being watched, but I know I wouldn't appreciate it. I believe live streaming a class room can be beneficial but under certain circumstances. The live streaming in China has parents watching and commenting on everything the class does. I think that if the live streams are only open for students who are either absent or would like to review the lessons, it can be beneficial. When there is the pressure of getting in trouble and having to act perfectly then you become more focused on that than the actual lesson. If that pressure disappears and it is just for the benefit of students learning or making up lessons, then it is acceptable. I feel that students and will behave differently under these circumstances, as we behave differently around our parents and adults 2: One of the classrooms did for a time as a result of building construction (the old cafeteria got converted into some classrooms and got moved, so there was a camera in one of them) and people acted differently as a result 3: Privacy, security are a couple of things I feel would be lost. I feel the gain would be more minimal, maybe better behavior, even at that, it wouldn't be much better.

I would not like it if my classmates and I were live streamed in class. It takes away privacy, and for kids who already dislike presenting, it would make them very uncomfortable knowing that many people could be watching. Much self confidence would be lost if students were constantly under surveillance. It's already difficult to make mistakes in front of your classmates, and it would be even harder to make mistakes in front of the many people who could be watching. Score: 0.0 I think surveillance will make everyone act differently. Everyone would act more polite and kind if they knew they were being watched. I think surveillance will make students do better in school if they know their parents are watching. It will help students gain better grades. It will also make them lose their privacy, and privacy is important. I think that surveillance and live streaming does make kids act differently. They most likely behave better because there is a chance that their parents are watching. But, it probably makes the students very uncomfortable, because they can never know for sure who's watching them. School is supposed to be a safe environment. I think that cameras in the classroom make students self conscious about their answers, especially if they are wrong. Parents are watching their children in school, and it seems to take away students' social lives because they know that anything they do in class, their parents are watching them. I think having servailince in classrooms would change students majorly because they will stop messing around and talking knowing that there are always cameras watching them. I think it does make the teachers and students behave differently because if they are doing something bad they will get caught and there will be consequences If I could go back in time, I would\u2019ve live-streamed Seneca and Nero.

Pretty much the same thoughts as everyone else: IONESCO was a gimme, and I was reminded of the time in my long-ago and penniless youth when I second-acted Rhinoceros on Broadway and got to see Zero Mostel's metamorphosis. UNIVAC should have been a gimme, but I had trouble remembering which of those early computers was not Eniac. RAINBOW was a gimme, although I've never heard of it in connection with ice cream. The mind reels. SHELTIE was a welcome gimme, making me think of my late beloved Molly. She was part either SHELTIE or collie--I think the former--with a generous helping of all-pupose terrier. Couldn't remember ARGOS's name. Was surprised to see GINORMOUS without some qualifier. SWEETS before treats, GUARDS before YEOMEN, VALLEY before TROUGH.

Realized what the quotation marks around best friend meant but couldn't think of his name. Fill-ins led to corrections led to crosses. I should have gotten TOWHEE because I've been seeing them in the yard, but didn't know they were also called chewinks. Was thinking there must be a more technical term for TROUGH.

We misjudge people with these labels without asking for their opinion on matters such as gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, views, and many other categories. We jump to these conclusions by comparing these people to others and grouping them in one box as a whole based on few similarities. These conclusions are unfair and are disrespectful to the people whom we try to drop in organized boxes of social norms. I have definitely found myself being put into one of these boxes as a fem. gay boy, or Mexican because I have a darker complexion. Society needs to stop trying to understand everything and should focus more of their energy on who they are and being completely that. so great a difference between being labeled by others and being forced by others to choose a label. If you want your own identity, don\u2019t check any boxes. This image is the depiction of the crushing labels we all face as a society, whether it be simple labels that are characteristically placed on school social groups, or ones that are more commonly conceived with gender. This labeling has begun to be brought up as something we as a society should know more about in order to communicate with people in a way that is beneficial to the lot of us. Gender labeling is like a tale as old as time, though this time around, things are being shaken up and changed. This means that people are to no longer be labeled based on what they wear, how they act, and how you identify them. People will identify themselves as what they are, not what you define them as. This Image shows how our society is quick to label different people based on their appearances. labels can be very harmful to people and I believe everyone should refrain from labeling other people based on looks. in society today this is what most people do to one another and they could just be thinking of that label or say it out loud it still wrong. The image portrays this very strongly and it helps people bring to mind that labeling is not right and it is very rude and cruel. This picture represents the negative effects our labeling and quick judgement have on society. The most prominent illustrating detail that I notice is the fear overtaking the faces of these people as well as the blank expressions of those who have been labelled. Labelled people have become so accustomed to these assigned labels that they don't have the ardor to fight it anymore. Labeling has become such a huge function of our everyday society that people, myself included, can't walk into a room without automatically making assumptions about people they know nothing about. It is these assumptions that stop people from expressing who they truly are and I think that is a major message of this image. We need to stop making people feel like a stranger in their own body. We need to accept people as they are and judge them on their character and not how they present themselves. We need to respect people\u2019s decisions and not decide who someone is based on who they are physically. Stop the assumptions and the mislabeling, we are just destroying each other. When worrying about the personalities and individuals of the around 10,000 people we will meet in out lifetime, our brains take many shortcuts. Quickly classifying people into categories and making assumptions is one thing we do to clear out the clutter. It's not inherently a bad thing, but it is important to correct it when it inevitably fails. Most people are fine falling into the categories that are given to them, so it can be bizarre to run into an exception. You may think that it is ridiculous, that you shouldn't have to change, or that they are lying for attention, but I would rather give people the benefit of the doubt as long as they can handle me making mistakes. If you truly can't stand to call somebody by what they prefer, you are under no obligation to talk to them, and they don't have to talk to you either. Other people's choices are not yours to make. This picture represents more than just people being pushed down or feelling the worse about themselves. This picture shows that people are able to watch another person get pushed around and 'stamped' on. In the bottom of this picture there is a man watching a women about to be 'stamped' and he is just watching instead of helping a person in need. I do believe that this might show signs of gender roles, but I also believe that it shows how people are friendly and don't help each other out. If everyone would help a friend or a stranger in need then there would be no reason for stamps or labels of any kind. In this image I see fear. Fear and anxiety and disappointment that labels are what define us. In the picture there are men and women all trapped under their labels unable to move. The labels that they have been given don't suit who they are or who they want to be and it is not up to society to give them those labels. It is so terrible that people today who are not at home in their own body need to be scared of expressing their true selves. It is time to look past what you see on the outside and let the person that you get to know on the inside label who you are. This image portrays to me the negative effect labelling has on society. Stamps with 'HIM' or 'HER' in bold lettering litter the image, holding down several people. Blue and red are the only colours in the picture, reinforcing the fact that gender can be categorised by even colour. The people in black and white makes them seem secondary to the labels that have been placed on them, which reflects how often people regard others in terms of those labels and nothing else. Once you are labelled it is hard to shake off the perceptions that come with the label, and it is even harder to change labels; we can see in the image that those who have got a label are pinned to the ground by it, and seem to be somewhat resigned to their fate. Those who are not yet pinned down by a label are obviously agitated, and are trying to avoid the stamps. I would interpret this as those in society who are not as easily held down by a label, or do not think any label defines who they are. In my eyes, and probably the eyes of many others\u2019, this image is a commentary on gender labeling and how our society \u201cstamps\u201d everyone with what they deem acceptable. This comment is coming from an outsider who doesn\u2019t quite understand the world depicted by artist Eleanor Davis, but also by someone who hopes to learn more. Within this picture, a gigantic stamp is being brought down on some people labeling them either \u201cHim\u201d or \u201cHer.\u201d Everyone in the picture has a look of distressed showing that these labels probably aren't favored. This connects to our societies growing conversation on Gender labeling and growing division on being transgender. I personally think this message of labeling and how we need it to stop and it\u2019s doing so much more harm than good needed to be said. This picture stresses a real issue of equality in our country in an easy to understand way to appeal and reach out to the broadest audience possible. I agree with what\u2019s being said with this picture and hope for a more understanding country in the years to come. I believe that this image is representing the term known as, Labelling. In today's society, we are becoming more liberal, and more open-minded - at least, some people are. At least, some people are. This picture shows stamps with pronouns on them, being stamped onto people, who at first glance, wouldn't normally fit under the specified pronoun. Some people represented in the image appear to be cowering away from the large stamp, as if they don't want it. This could be an example of misgendering. Finding alternate pronouns is a growing fairly common for some. however, not everyone accepts their alternate pronouns - labelling by what they deem fit, instead. After reading the linked article, I have discovered that I am fairly correct with my assumptions, and that this is about the use of pronouns. The author states that they themselves use gender neutral, they/them pronouns, and they go on to say how many other youth feel the same as them. Labelling and forcing views can be crushing, is the real point - hence the person being crushed by a large stamp. Don't assume things. This image represents how labeling can affect people. People can get crushed by these unjust labels that were put upon them. Once they have been labeled, they can never escape from it. The people in the depicted image are being labelled as a specific gender, without considering preference. They are being labelled as being their gender from birth. This often makes people feel trapped or hopeless. As a community, we need to break through these stamps and stand up for ourselves and each other before these situations get worse. How easy it is for someone to reject an entire person\u2019s identity when they\u2019re unable to feel and see through the eyes of the people they discriminate and ignore. The naive and disrespectful individual will say that it\u2019s \u201ctoo confusing\u201d or \u201cfrustrating\u201d to correctly address someone, but I can assure you far more frustrating to the person that has to deal with mislabeling and discrimination than it is for the protester who fulminates against the different genders and sexualities of others. Two of my friends came out as non-binary last year, but they\u2019re still uncomfortable with telling more than a handful of people about it. They worry about facing harassment and mockery if they tell anyone outside of the immediate friend circle, and while I respect their decision, I still wish this didn\u2019t have to be a concern. Too often society stamps a label on a person just because they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d how someone can be a they or change their gender. But you don\u2019t have to understand it, because only other non-binary individuals can know what it's like to be non-binary, and only transgender people can know what it\u2019s like to be trans (etc.). As a modern society in the pursuit of equality, we need to be more open-minded to our fellow humans, simply because like any other citizen, they deserve just as much respect and proper treatment as everyone else. Score: 1 This image is simply stating the dangers of labels handed out by society. The truth is, we have very little control over our own lives, the people around us dictate almost everything. Take the image for example, you can insist all you want that your pronouns are she her but depending on who's around you We can make choices and decisions and do everything possible thing to achieve something and say I'm going to do this but at the end of the day it will be the people around us (whether it be society, teachers, parents, etc.) who decide what we'll really do and how successful we'll be at it. The body language and facial expressions in thus image further accent the danger of the power society holds and the danger of labels. The danger being that it can take away your identity and ultimately destroy you. Score: 0 This image reflects our society today, Labels. To label something is to assign that title to them or it. People are unfairly labeled with stereotypes everyday; the jock, the preppy kid, the nerd, the popular kid. Labels are dangerous and too commonly seen in our modern day lives, with gendering as well. Everyday whether we realize it or not, we assign genders to almost everything such as shoes or bookbags and clothes. On a daily basis people assume genders, this frustrates a lot of people in our society, and we could be offending them. This pictures depicts the dangers of a label, in the picture some of the people look afraid of the stamp/label and others just seem fine, as if they were accepting their fate We are being crushed by these labels and they are starting to take over our lives. We need to strip ourselves of our labels and stop stereotyping people by the color of their skin, the length of their hair, or the clothes they wear. At the end of the day we are all humans and we all have feelings , let's treat each other how we would like to be treated. I think that this image is saying that everyone gets labels. The labels we are given are like stamps. They stick around until you try to wash them off, or break the label you are given. Labels are based of what you look like, who you are, and even who you hang out with. Today, in society, people are labeled by all the stereotypes that are around us. We judge people based on where they came from or how they dress. We do this because we assume things about someone based on prior information we know about people that look like them. Sometimes the message of labeling can be good, if you have a positive label upon you, but in other cases, there could be a negative connotation if your label is negative. Score: 1 The world will tell you hundreds of times that you will not be labelled. They pinky-promise you that you can float through and scrape by without anyone telling you who you are, that you can be whoever you want to be. They cross their hearts and hope to die that they will not judge. They are lying. The world forces labels on everyone - whether we like it or not. Our world is twisted, my friends. They\u2019ll draw you in with pledges of neutrality, they\u2019ll seduce you with swears of this and that, and then they will break each and every one of them. The looming hand will still stamp you. Who is stamping you is up to you - sometimes it\u2019s simply society, other times it\u2019s a family member. There is truthfully only pink or blue. There is truthfully only A or B. There is no grey. They will tell you that there is, of course, but when you say that you are a C, when you say that you are a grey, they will just decide for themselves that you are actually a B, that you are actually a blue. The world loves stuffing people in boxes, they love tattooing things onto people, they love seeing human beings as statistics or anatomical qualities. It\u2019s how it has always been. It\u2019s up to you to rip the labels off, to throw them into the ocean and scrub the ink off that they have stamped on you. You can always jump out of the box, you can always remove tattoos. Score: 0 This image shows how people can feel oppressed because of pronouns that are assigned to them at birth. These people wish that society gave them more freedom to explore which gender they wish to become. Hopefully as a society, we can a knowledge their struggles. Score: 1 In today's society, people are absurdly quick in making judgments for others due to their physical characteristics, gender, political view and ethnicity. The rise of 2017 has ushered in a new wave of societal view; A wave characterized by the resurgence of identity politics. Many companies and state-founded institutions are now beginning to accept candidates on the basis of their labels. Top companies no longer hire genuinely skilled individuals, but rather resort to hiring those whom meet their racial, gender, and political preferences. Take a look at Silicon Valley; A place which we once looked upon as the crevice of human intelligence - now seen as the beacon of societal quotas. Our country must let go of these practices and go forth into a job market which hires workers on the presumption of their character and skill, not their looks. After all, the most important diversity in the world is the one which we cannot label: the diversity of thought. Score: 0 In this image the first thing I notice is the facial expressions and body language that these people are showing. Most of their faces are plastered with a frightened or upset expression. The next thing I notice is that the people who have been stamped, are trapped under their stamp, and those who are about to be stamped look distressed. I believe that this image is saying that by stamping labels on people, traps them in that label. When we \u201cstamp\u201d labels on people, it\u2019s demoralizing them. In society today, a big topic is labels. When I see the labels in this image that say \u201cher\u201d and \u201chim\u201d, the first thing I think of that\u2019s been a trending topic in today\u2019s society is people who are transgender. Usually people who are against people that are transgender don\u2019t like to call them by the pronoun they prefer. They label them and make them feel that they are only that label. No one is just a label. We are all humans who have different personalities and unique features. No one should be simply known as just a label, we are all complex and way more than just a \u201chim\u201d or a \u201cher\u201d. Everyone has their own unique traits and should be known by who they are as a person, not what they are. This image shows how easily society tends to put labels on people. This can be based on their actions, looks, skin color, knowledge, or even wealth. The image emphasizes how these labels stick to a person and limit them to certain standards which are hard to escape. This could later influence how people see themselves and make it hard for them to completely express their true personality and potential since they practically have a foot being tied to a rope. Every time we use a labeling pronoun, it's like tightening the rope until the person really can not any longer willingly move on their own. This image is portraying the fact that labels are a major problem in today's society. We label people by the characteristics they show all the time. We think of a particular person as being a bully, a nerd, a musician, or an athlete. Labels don't just change the perception of other people but it can even change what we think of ourselves. Some labels hurt, and people start to wonder that maybe they are true, maybe what everyone is saying is right. The language we use sets a tone and also reflects on us. We need to stop labeling people! To me this image is representing the current issue of labeling. Everyone labels people and everyone gets labeled. Labeling hold people back from doing what they love and strive to do. This image makes me sad because I believe you can do or be anything you want as long as you work for it but all labels are holding us back from do that. I think that this image is very powerful. It is showing how people in our society are putting labels on everyone. These stamps are labeling someone's gender. Our society has become a lot more accepting to different genders, but people are still labeling people with these pronouns. This is showing the effect of how people are dealing with these labels.

I make it a point not to break a sweat and try to dress as lightly as possible. Lately, besides a regular shovel, I use a back-friendly one, angled differently. With that shovel, I often dig in and then reverse, and pull it, with the handle in front. It save lifting the shovel. But I use the regular shovel, too. If I have to, I wait about 45 min and go out for a second round of shoveling, occasionally three.

What about statistics for women? I'm a 74 year old widowed (a little overweight) female, who still shovels snow - with SOME vigor. Though I have a faithful plow guy for the driveway, I still have to shovel lots of walkways and that long rough path from the driveway to the heating oil outlet pipe in my backyard (for the delivery guy) - and sometimes that hillock of icy snow left by the town plows at the end of our driveways. and there is almost always that gnawing nub of fear that this time could be IT \u2026 I\u2019ve learned to carry my cell in my pocket at all times just in case I fall into a drift (and can't get up!)

For the first few months I was pseudo-carving turns in our house. I hope to get back to it, regularly, upon retirement. Re skiing powder, the trick is to carve gently with both skies, and, almost NO ONE will tell you this, but keep your weight a bit back. Well, an Olympic Gold nedalist once told me this.

This year we have had over 10. Allan Rydberg asks: \u201cSo is exercise good or not?\u201d Last year the international Cochrane\u2019s Collaborative updated their older meta-analysis of Randomized Control Trials, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of medical evidence, on exercise programs for cardiac rehabilitation. They compiled the results of 63 studies with over 14,000 participants. Compared to those not undertaking cardiac rehabilitation exercise, the results were that, while coronary deaths were reduced: \u201cThere was no significant effect on total mortality, myocardial infarction, or revascularization.\u201d PMID: 26764059 So it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that strenuous activities/exercise kills older folks. Same amount of heart attacks and if those don\u2019t kill you, the respiratory infections you get will. Score: 5 I can only point out that almost everything I have heard on this subject assumes that snow shoveling is exactly equivalent to other forms of exercise. This might be true, but it has not been confirmed. The problem with the cardiac rehab studies is that they have been done only on people needing cardiac rehab: people with known recent heart damage. As far as I can tell, the snow-shovel effect also applies to people not in rehab. There also seems to be a plausible mechanism for this effect. At least whenever I have done it, snow shoveling involves a lot of shock loading to major muscle groups. One poster here mentioned the difference between aerobic gym equipment and heavy weights.

Also, hidden away in its Supplemental Content data at the JAMA Network site: those randomized to physical exercise also had more deaths and life-threatening events than the controls (RR=1.09) and more hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons (RR=1.21).

Axe stands there, spitting and simmering, shaking with rage, unable to comprehend why they hate him so much. Axe doesn't realize that he has come up against the clubby WASP power structure that hates him for being an outsider. It's not just about how much money you have, but it's about your breeding.

In this scene Axe realizes he'll never be a member of the club, and the realization infuriates him. This episode cuts to the heart of the problem, the source of the conflict between Chuck and Axe that drives the series. I never thought I'd be rooting for a hedge fund guy Whatever Axe's character failings may be, they pale in significance when compared to the slimy, sickening, self-enamoured Chuck Rhoades and his equally repulsive, serpentine dad.

Now please understand that I admire and respect the exceptional talent of, among others, Giamatti, Lewis and Akerman (of the unfairly dispatched Trophy Wife, a rare TV comedy of manners that met its demise far too young), but the plotting is simply a paean to wealth, vanity, excess and endless deceit and betrayal.

Yes, it was all testosterone-y and everything, but the actors gave it their melodramatic bests with great success. And, I loved the look on Chuck's dad's face as he was witnessing what he thinks is the unraveling of a hedge-fund titan. Whether or not he is correct doesn't matter, we've been primed for all out war (like the one between the Saviors and Rick's team on The Walking Dead), which is likely to be highly entertaining. One question though: When will the sexual tension between Bobby and Wendy be acknowledged and perhaps acted upon? Does anyone really believe Bobby isn't deeply attracted to her? Yes, having her would decimate her husband, but that's just icing on the cake. A man like Bobby likes to own everything within reach, and Wendy is one of those things. And, does anyone believe that somewhere deep inside Wendy there isn't at least some curiosity lust for Bobby? Remember that scene when she got into his pool with him? Bobby's wife certainly seems to be aware of something lurking unsaid between them because she practically hisses whenever Wendy's name comes up.

His interaction with Axe is even more breathtaking: he had the upper hand throughout.

Score: 3.0 But it just appears to be some vulgar TV show with Trump-like characters. Score: 1.0 Going to the Yale Club was a bad move, but I think we can sympathize with Axe's feelings a little: the way Black Jack Foley made it clear to him that a) Foley has already picked sides, and being old-school loyal, b) Axe will never have his friendship, is just brutal. And unfair, as Axe never had the chance. A benefit of old money and family connections is that somebody got there first, and secured all the advantages well before you were even born. And that's it, there's nothing you can do about that. If Axe really is such a big picture thinker, shouldn't he put aside his feud with Chuck for the time-being, thereby avoiding conflict with Black Jack Foley, and slowly cultivate friendship with Foley where their interests do align? Surely being allies with a figure far more powerful than Chuck is more important than whatever satisfaction he gets from hurting Chuck. Score: 0.0 Axe can take down Rhoades and Jack Foley in their own game now, they are sitting ducks. The key here is for Axe to team up with the man who sent his kid to the special summer camp. If Axe puts capital behind that guy, he can use him because he now shares the same disdain for Chuck, and also has a similar background to Axelrod, working his way up by working hard, but also not forgetting where he came from. If Chuck decides to pull the trigger on his findings about the summer camp, Axe can also provide ammunition to reveal that it was the Older Rhoades, in combination with Jack Foley who destroyed the Sandicott deal to spite the townspeople, and how Axe invested in the town because he believed in it, like its citizens. If Rhoades thinks he can play ball with Axe he has it wrong, Axe is gonna burry him and his father for what they did to him. I really hope Axe strikes back hard and does what I described above. Chuck is becoming a part of the group of people that he once swore to bring down. As far as Foley goes, this could be Axelrod's way of moving into the top or elite. Once Foley sees whats going on, he's going to want to move away from Rhoades as much as possible, and try to look for a way to back another candidate. But by that time it will be over for him too, and if Axe is successful in swaying the public vision with his candidate, its only a matter of time before Foley's revenue streams break away from him, leaving Axe to burry him and Rhoades once and for all. Score: 6.0 David Strathairn is always a great addition to a cast. The actors in this show are tremendous; I just wish the writing and the plots were a bit better. I admit, I don't recall all the plot elements of the Danny Margolis story; but I do recall that he attempted to record Axe saying something incriminating, but Axe made him right away and didn't say anything. I even remember the 'sweaty hand' comment Axe made after Margolis left. But I thought in exchange for doing that, he got off? Did he end up going to jail because he failed to get anything on Axe? Score: 1.0 I really loved Season 1 but Season 2 is starting to show some writer fatigue. Just a few examples: Each episode seems to have one scene involving a conversation between Wendy and Chuck. And each episode alternates between its over and lets make up. If they had a man dressed as a bee it would make compelling Telenovella a la the Simpsons. The writers also badly need a lawyer consulting. The jury selection for the banker that went to jail was only a day or two after his arrest. In real life these would be many months apart at best. And this episode was perhaps the worst. Axe bursts into the Yale club and confesses to the US DA that he had engaged in insider trading by buying the city's bonds. That confession was enough to jail Axe. Yet Rhodes ignores it. On a lesser scale, why did seeing a picture from a party where 100's attended lead Axe to conclusively know that it was the Rhodes who conspired with Foley to jam the casino license? For a quant like Axe that is insufficient evidence at the very least. It reminds me of the Star Wars formula where in each movie (in this case season) the fate of the antagonists and protagonists flip flop. In this case, however, as in an MMA match (not that I watch that stuff), since there is no one to like, it still makes for interesting cliffhangers. There's a little too much over the top Wolf of Wall Street type sleaze for me otherwise, fun stuff. Score: 14.0 Hmmm, and outer borough rich guy who can't find acceptance with the entrenched elite. Where have we heard that story before? Axe stays out of the inner circle because he wants to; he will fund charities, and put his name on buildings when he wants to so he can join the group whenever he wants to fully conform to the rules. But he knows that if if does that he loses his edge. The other guy could never do it because he lacks the brains and the skills. A fun contrast."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Additionally, I lived almost half of my time there in SoHo, and was with a block of numerous people who, if elsewhere, would draw much attention. This is because as a rule, most people living in the city ignore celebrities. This is done (in order) mostly out of respect, being self absorbed and ignorance.

Score: 1 This video shows a girl asking questions that are confusing to most of us or we really do not know the answer to. Kids tend to ask so many question when they are little because they are just too young to understand how the world is. Some of the questions that this little girl asked are questions that only God knows such as, \u201cWhen are we going to die?\u201d, and \u201cWhen was the world created?\u201d. Even adults do not know the answer to some of the questions a little girl asks. Once kids grow up, they know the answers to what they asked when they were little. Score: 0 what stood out to me in this film is how many me questions we ask on a regular basis as we grow up. this stood out to me because when watching the film i related to some of the questions she asked because i asked some of the same questions to my mother. the film really showed me how us kids aren't afraid of asking questions that may be offensive to others, and that we just want answer and to be informed on whats going on. As children grow up their understanding of the world is very vague and confusing to most children. Because of this, children tend to ask lots of questions about what's going on or why something is happening. If found it interesting that some of the questions the little girl gave were really easy to answer, and some of the questions were so hard that adults couldn't have answered them themselves. The film really showed me how kids aren't afraid of asking questions that might be a topic of controversy, they just want to know what's going on and to be informed of this information. always asking a lot of questions, always. He is almost 27 now by back then , it was not easy to record and keep those memories for ever as it is today... I regret now not having registered all those beautiful an plenty of meaning questions. I always told him that more important than the answers, were the questions. They illustrate the individuals surrounding the curious kid his or her level of awareness, how he or she perceives the world at that early age, which I believe defines his personality when grown up. what are the mechanisms behind these changes? Are they more socially and collectively related or internallly and due more to the individual personality? When I was a kid I would usually ask questions to my father that he did not know. I remember when I asked my dad, \u201cWhen are we all going to die?\u201d, and then he would tell me that only God knew when we were all going to die. As I have grown up my curiosity for asking those questions has been decreasing. Also, I now understand the answers to questions I asked when I was little. It is good for kids to ask those questions so they know how the world is. One day the curiosity ends. This film is very nostalgic because it can remind us of a time when we would ask an endless amount of questions. These questions are some that I might have and some are silly questions that children ask which is great because they might actually be questions adults have. These are questions of everyday life that are crucial to us. This film shows us that children are not fearful of asking controversial questions which is something we can learn from because it is very easy to be frightful and silent, or following the crowd. This film can remind us to never stop asking questions because if we do we can never advance as a society. As children we have seemingly endless questions due to our lack of understanding of this world which is shown very obviously in this film. But I think the big part about this film is that it shows that this is true for adults also. If you listened to the little girls questions some of them were very easy to answer, but some of them even adults could not answer and we are still searching for the answers to those questions. Basically this video shows that we are just like children and will always be, because no matter what we will always have questions we cannot answer. Your statement about how some of her questions were not answered easily by adults is true because they are controversial questions. We are so fearful of asking questions because they are controversial or offensive to we remain silent. I also agree with the statement about how we are just like children because we will always have questions but the thing is, will we ask them? We are so fearful of the questions we have that we continue to be ignorant. From this video, we can learn that children are not afraid of asking these questions because to them they are just questions they have. We need to be more like them and stop being fearful of the people we might offend because we are only harming ourselves with our lack of knowledge. i also believe that her questions was not easy to answer by adults because they are controversial questions. we dont like to ask questions that may offended people because the way you may phrase or it seems like you are stereotyping. from this video i can take away children are not afraid to ask questions because theyy are just questions they dont know that the questions they ask have meaning behind them After watshing this film, I realize that there are so many things in the world that we see as really simple but we can not explain. Children seem to ask these questions very oftern but it is surprising when we wonder what we have given them as answers. Majority of the times, we see these questions as simple and very child-like and because of this we do not think beyond the core of these questions. These questions are everyday things that we look at and see them as things that just happen. We oftern answer the question how does life live by stating that it just does, If we looked beyond the it just does we would be more curious about everyday processes. An emotion that comes up as I am rethinking the curiosity of children is that I realize how sad it is to dismiss their couriosity simply because we think we are smarter than them but really we need to be the ones thinking. Children ask questions because they want to make sense of what they have seen or heard. It is apart of growing up and expanding their knowledge naturally. I would say that grown-ups should nurture that curiousity by telling them the truth or telling them what they think is the answer to their questions but afterwards say it's just what I think to let them know there are other thoughts out there too about the answer to the question. My mother I know never wanted us to grow up in oblivion which I am so thankful for she did protect em from certain things but the point is answer the child even if it is a simple question and if you do not know the answer then say i don't know or the child what they think the answer is or give your own thought to the answer even if some others may disagree. As we get older we don't ask as many questions as we think of because sometimes we are scared that it might cause a negative reaction or it's too private to talk about and we don't wan to pry into people's lives unwanted. Some people tell us as we get older that we should know the answer to our questions or o do our own research but if it is genuine the least a person could do is reply to one. We should ask questions only if we feel it is going to eat us alive if we do not know the answer to it otherwise we do not want to disrupt the lives of others by asking something. Now that I think about it, sometimes humans make things SEEM so complex when it is not. Children are curious about how everything function and often ask about what they have see or hear because the want to have an explanation to what they just experienced and make sense of the world. As human grow older this curiosity might fade because life become more like a routine. Older people might be more hesitant to ask question that might be odd, offensive or unsettling, they are more worried about the answer. I was surprise that the little girl in the film ask so many complex questions about life and humanity which does not have a simple answer. I think the message of this film is for people to continue asking questions and look for answer because it can lead to new discover. I agree, curiousity is very important. If we were more curious in our older ages, much more would be discovered and we would never stop discovering new things because we would never stop wonder the whys, whens, hows, and ifs. Children in there early ages are much less likely to be able to do things that odler kids and adults would and that is what makes the dwidleling curiosity problem so problematic. Children think but don't have much power to do but we have the power to do andwe stoped thinking beyond and all we see is what is there not what can be or how what is there actualy got there. I agree with what you are saying, children ask many questions because they do not understand the world like we do. We also tend to ask a lot less questions than children because we tend to be afraid to. Like you said we tend to be afraid to because we are afraind our peers may look at us different , or think of us as stupid, dumb, etc.. But this fear is a huge roadblock in our lives and can lead us to miss out on learning or discovereing new things. I agree with your statement on the curiosity of the children. Children tend to ask more questions because of them not having much knowledge about the world during that age. So kids want to know as much information as possible. People are often afraid of asking a question that might affect them in a negative way but kds aren't afraid of the consequences, they just want to know the answer to their many questions It never occurred to me how many simple questions we asked as children, some that are even difficult for adults to answer. It is interesting to see how kids have no fear to ask meaningful questions at a young age. We never truly realize how observant children are and how much they actually know about the world. Children often are fearless and tend to ask questions that we fear asking ourselves on a daily basis. Children ask so many questions all because they simply want to gain knowledge that will potentially better them for the future. I agree that children does not worry about asking the wrong question, they are not scared of the answer they might receive which allow them to continue seeking answers unlike people who are older. Their curiosity lead to a willingness to listen and learn about the world around them. This is a good quality to have. Some of their questions can be difficult to answer like when the little girl ask \u201chow does life live\u201d or why some people are mean because it is not something that have a simple explanation and can be interpreted in different ways. I was also surprise about how observant the little girl is. It surely occurred to me how many simple questions children ask because I get asked those a lot growing up with younger ones. However, I forgot how sometimes answers to those questions can be difficult at times like you say. Sometimes questions are hard to answer because we don't want to say the wrong thing or put something negative into a child's head all because of us so that is why it is so hard. I agree that kids are observant because they are curious and want to know more about the world which is why they ask why so much. Youth doesn't mean any harm when it comes to actually wanting the answer to something because we don't know the answer it's just about information that could potentially better them for the future like you said. Even as adults, humans ask many questions throughout their lifetime. Many of the same question the two girls were asking such as Why are you on your phone. many parents ask their children that question all the time. Every human once asked that question in their lifetime before. Just as the two girl asking why questions, lots of scientist ask why questions throughout their experiment. Not only scientist can obtain as much information as possible to better understand the observation/s to come up with a reasonable hypothesis by asking question, which is in a different article. Even if people are not scientist, it's still great to ask questions especially when your young because your gain a better understanding of things people have problems comprehending. Score: 1 When we\u2019re young, we ask questions. Some questions have simple answers, others are harder to explain. Questions with seemingly simple answers can be hard to explain while questions we think have hard to understand answers are actually very simple to answer. As we grow older, we think that so many questions are redundant and frankly annoying but we shouldn\u2019t. Children aren\u2019t afraid to ask the big questions and they don\u2019t shy away from the answers they receive. They take it in with open arms and cherish it, understanding the wisdom and knowledge it possesses. With questions comes understanding and with understanding, wisdom. They want to listen and learn all that they can because their one hope and dream is to grow up and know everything just like their parents and teachers and every adult they know. Children ask the questions we\u2019re afraid to ask ourselves, and although we may fear giving them the answer because we feel they aren\u2019t old enough to understand it thoroughly, children want the answers, they seek them out as if they need them to survive. Which, in a way, they do need the answers to survive. Without knowledge, there would be no growth. No one would live long enough to bring about change, or even know what change was or how to initiate it. Children ask a lot of questions, and if we aren\u2019t careful, we push them aside and view their inquiries as pointless when really, children are the key to knowing what questions to ask and give the motivation to find the answers. Score: 0 I agree with Olivia Mealo that Children ask many questions. When the children ask these question people should help motivate children to find the answer to their questions without telling them the answer. In my opinion, this would help the children rely more on themselves than others and help them become more independent. I completely agree with Olivia Mealo statement children need the answer, to survive, without knowledge, there would be no growth. Without people such as children asking questions and wanting to get an answer the world would never bring about change or enhance technology. Therefore people should motivate children to ask questions and allow them to find the answer. So they can grow up into an independent woman or man. To add on I think it's so cute that Children are not afraid to ask big questions. I also agree that children ask a load of questions about the world. I believe that we should always answer children's questions and help them gain essential knowledge that will potentially help the progress as a person in the future and even in the present at a young age. I agree that by providing these children with knowledge, we can help them become more independent and successful."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

The fact that you mention the book was written with Stalin and Hitler in mind and base your entire article on parallels to America today, at best shows a total lack of historical perspective and at worst an irresponsible distortion of reality to promote the Times' agenda. Is the irony lost on you that were there true parallels to the Trump administration this article would not even be allowed to be published? I would suggest it is you doing the indoctrination with promoting such a highly inflammatory and biased lesson plan to ideally be put into circulation in our schools. You shamelessly attempt to drill your elitist out of touch views into the minds of the highly susceptible American youth. Furthermore, if you truly believe we are headed towards a Stalinist style regime I suggest you leave quickly as intellectuals are normally the first to go.

The United States should have spoken out after Devos, a woman who suggested that guns should be allowed in school \u201cin case there was a bear\u201d, was appointed secretary of education. In 1984, the Party vaporized anyone who didn\u2019t agree with the Party\u2019s ways. This is all too similar to Trump firing Preet Bharara, Sally Yates, James Comey, and threatening to fire Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Robert S. Mueller III, Tom Prince, Nikki Haley, Stephen K. Bannon, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, and Jeff Sessions. All of these individuals threatened Trump\u2019s success in some way, so he fired or threatened to fire them. This is too similar to the vaporization of anyone who threatened the success of the party. So, when you say that this novel does not have any accurate parallels to the political atmosphere under the Trump administration, you are implying that his pathological lying and firing of anyone who threatens him with an opinion other than him is acceptable and shouldn\u2019t draw concern.

However, he said that they're equals - but that Prohibition marked the slide of Irish whiskey in the American public psyche, as the Irish complied with Prohibition rules, and were at a disadvantage for many years after it ended, whereas the canny Scots simply sold to Canada, and let cross-border sales and smuggling keep rivers of Scottish whiskey flowing into America, and the American consumer consciousness, giving it a prominence that lingers to this day, despite the apparent parity between both countries' whiskeys. Interestingly, despite widespread international views and self-inflicted stereotypes, the Irish drink a *lot* less today than we used to, with close to 30% of bars and pubs closing over the past decade, due to rising health trends and diminishing money in financially struggling Ireland.

Since weight cycling, aka yo yo dieting, is the risk factor for deadly heart attacks and strokes, this study suggests-- and the practice of dieting is the cause of weight cycling, this piece would do well to point out that a practice our culture and medical profession is obsessed with is the true culprit. Dieting continues to fail for 95% of the population. This statistic is still accurate and has been unchanged since dieting was invented. Overweight folks can still reduce their risk by adopting healthier life practices like becoming more physically active, and thereby reducing their risk level without losing drastic amounts of weight or engaging in extreme caloric restriction ( a diet) which is a set up for weight cycling. This popular practice is still not seen as part of the problem versus a solution. There are also studies that indicate that even maintaining a high weight (without gaining more) causes less cardiac risk than weight cycling. Our obsession with weight loss often over shadows the evidence that gradually changing food choices, becoming more active, quitting smoking, etc. will also reduce risk and will lead to a lower weight in a healthier more balanced manner. Even those who consider themselves to have a food addiction would do well to look at moving more and considering a non diet approach to lifestyle change such as intuitive or mindful eating and a healthier lifestyle no matter what your size.

This is one of the reasons financial independence is important to me. My parents are very well reasoned and will help if possible as long as I,m not asking for too much. If my parents offered to help I would most likely accept their offer depending on the situation, and how financially stable I am. If they couldn't afford to help, I do wish they would at least be able and ready to help me if I needed it bad enough, but if they cant then there is always a way to get around needing help, even if that way around is a harder path to take. I grew up literally middle class, with a median household income. Financial insecurity has affected all parts of my life\u2014no family car in high school was exhausting and isolating. I worked hard for the scholarships needed to go to undergrad, but had a serious health issue in my last term. The school loaned me $3k to cover living expenses as I recovered, due to my proven academic record. Without that loan, I would have dropped out; today I am a PhD student at Caltech.

I worked in industry for 2 years, lucky to land a job without help.

My savings are my safety net, and gave me the freedom to go back to school, and support my parents when my dad\u2019s terminal ill health forced them to move, subsidizing their monthly expenses while my sister cleared the house and sold it. Class, health, and caregiving are inextricably linked; even minor or temporary health problems can derail your life when there is no money to buffer the impact. I feel like getting financial help from your parents are fine but I feel like that's taking advantage of your parents. I mean I'm okay if my parents can help me with money. I will definitely accept the help they can give me. But I just feel like that's just using your parents to get money. If they can't afford to help, i just let them be. For most people they probably need their parents for most of their life. I'll probably need $2000 to start out then do the rest on my own cause I'm independent. Financial independence is definitely a goal for me. My parents are always willing to help me; however, as long as I could support myself, I would refuse their offers to help. I'm 16 I expect my parents will help me pay for college I would expect to make it through college you would have to recieve some financial help, most likely from our parents, seeing how expensive it is it would be quite hard to get through without help. My parents are gonna pay two years but they told me that I pay the last two because it h pls build character I'm 16 years old, and I'm planning on going to college. I am not expecting a lot of money from my parents because I am planning on reciving a sports scholarship to pay most of my college payment. I'm fine with asking my parents for financial help. They don't mind because they understand that even though I am making money, I'm saving it for a car and after that, to put towards college. They don't expect me to make enough money to pay for things in my own. I do have to pay for the extra things. They'll pay for me to go places with friends and food, but if there's something that I don't need and that's a good amount of money, I pay for it myself. I don't really feel bad asking for money from them. If it's really expensive I'm nervous to see how college works out. I'm trying to do what I can to get scholarships to go to UMaine. We've started saving but I don't want them to end up using all their money on me and not having a ton left. If I needed help financially my parents would offer me money but it's my responsibility to have that money I'm 14 years old, and I've been living OLD by both of , y parents that they will help me financially when I'm older. Their goal for me is to get me out of college debt free. They have already set up spare funds for me and my brother so if we ever need money fo some reason and it's dire , they can give us some money to help get us through the rough patch. When I graduate high school I excpect some help with college. I feel like having your parents help with rent is sort of weird. I hope that in the future I will be financially able to be independent. I believe that when I'm older my parents are going to help out with college expensive for the first couple of years but I'm sure I'll have to pay some things. If my parents of to offer I would accept there offer because I know in the long run it'll make me less stressed Aspects of life that could pose to be challenging as a young adult is defiantly the financial side of it. Most people will find themselves in debt after they graduate from college, some more than others depending on their financial stability. I feel very pressured to be looking at college right now but I think now the fact that it is so hard to get a job straight out of college and that your parents should help if you're really spiraling down in debt. I think that I am among the half of 20-somethings who will receive financial help from their parents. Mine have been saving up to help me pay for college and maybe beyond since i was born. It's hard to tell which peers are in the same place as me. You never really know. I plan on getting as big of a scholarship as possible. I try to work hard in school and get good grades and maybe my parents won't have to help as much. Whether your parents help you financially or not greatly affects you and the decisions that you make. If you aren't getting help from them, you might not be able to get into the college that you wanted to. Also, if you're aware that they're unable to help you ahead of time, you'd be willing to work harder in school, trying to earn a full paid scholarship. Parents should help with paying for college and possibly a start up apartment. If you always accept money from your parents, you'll never learn how to live on your own. I have personal experience with this, and eventually if you live off of your parents, it will be a lot harder to live on your own. My parents have already set aside money for me to go to college. Along with my older brother. When I was born my parents made an account that we are not aloud to take any money out. Only for college expenses. Every month my parents put money in the account and whenever I want to add money they will double it. Overall I do accept my parents to help me about but I will also be helping out a great deal as well. I'm 14, my parents agreed to pay for my first two years, they think getting debt is part of learning how to handle money. I think getting financial support is good, besides, who doesn't like free money. Not having the money is going to make me pick a cheaper college, I'm not trying to pay for 30 years of debt. I expect a little amount of financial help from my parents when I get out of high school and get ready for college because, I know they want me to succeed and will do as much as they can for me. I'm a 14 year old student and I do foresee myself accepting financial help. I think I am going to accept money to help pay for college, but I don't think I am going to need help for living expenses. I hope that being helped through college will allow me to be self sufficient afterwards. I do feel like I will get some financial support from parents. I think I will because they have good paying jobs I however do not expect a lot of help I expect my parents to pay for my first year of college, but I'm not sure beyond that because I'm the fourth kid out of five so that's a lot of money for college. I think my parents goal is to pay for the first full year of college for all of us. I'm 22 years old and soon to graduate from college. The importance of parental financial contribution for their post-college children cannot be overstated. When applying to jobs with no financial capital outside your own, every little detail of a potential job, ranging from public transit costs to health insurance, plays a huge role in determining what I can and can't apply for. I miss out on a lot of opportunities some others gain - some more ostentatious such as the the unpaid internship to break into more lucrative, higher-value roles, or the 3-month rent-free apartment in a major urban city to allow for ample time for job seeking. Some jobs I can't afford. I am a 20-something recent graduate living in NYC. I was lucky enough to have financial support from my parents throughout college, but am still burdened by a moderate amount of student loans. I now work in financial services and am compensated well enough that I am completely financially independent. However, if I had chosen a different career path I can confidently say that I would not be able to afford to live here without assistance. I cannot think of a single friend working in a creative industry (advertising, arts) that doesn't get financial aid from their parents in some form. Am I grateful for what I have? If I had wealthy parents with the resources and will to support me through my 20s would I have chosen a different career path? I am a 15-year-old high school student and I already hate asking for money , I feel that my parents worked hard to get to where they are and that I should earn my money. But at the same time my parents think I should earn a little but that i should just be a kid and have fun. I have a plan for when I am going to college, I am going to move in with my sister, work a part time, and go to school the rest of the time. The only time I'm going to ask for money is if I need it.

My parents have set me up pretty for living on my own, providing food for myself, and teaching me life skills I will need. Getting help from them will motivate me to work harder though, so I can thank them for the life they've been able to give me, not just lending me money when I'm in college. I'm a 15-year-old son that is getting closer to getting to college. My parents I expect to help a little but, i would do most of the work and get a job and pay for myself. I would like my parents to help when i really need it when I'm in a real jam and need some money really bad.

Several years later, once she'd moved, and my mother had left her a modest sum, she bought a nicer house in the city where she currently resides (an expensive college town). I think that was the best investment I ever made, aside from sending her to a private high school.

Depending upon one's personal situation, fitness and doctor's advisement, there's no reason why women can't assume normal athletic activities.

It brings back wonderful memories for me, someone who first encountered it during college at a tiny school in Lancaster County. Our Mandarin professor hosted us one evening to make spring festival dumplings. But the most memorable, for me, was the simple plate of eggs and tomatoes. It reminded me of a dish from my childhood, stewed tomatoes. But the addition of fried eggs and green onion transformed it into a literal pillow of comfort that I never forgot.

When I do, I also have to make mapo tofu, my other favorite comfort dish. Love how the sweetness/tartness of the tomato and eggs pairs with the spiciness of the tofu- and both go so well over rice! The main thing I do differently is I drizzle the sesame oil at the end. I've learned from trial and error that the taste will disappear if used early on. It may depend on type of sesame oil. I use the Kadoya brand which is arguably the best- it's made from roasted sesame seeds but has a low smoke point, so it's best to add it at the end for optimal taste bud happiness. Score: 4 Back in the early '80s -- when I lived with my wife and small child in northwest Beijing -- our friend, nanny, housekeeper Li Ai-yi [= Aunt Lee or Auntie Lee] made scrambled eggs and tomatoes often (though she couldn't have used ketchup).

Her contribution to our family-of-four's dinner table is something that I would normally call bland. She calls my Western contributions too tasty.  Dinners are a daily yin-yang of delights and near-misses, buoyed by a small raft of rice and pasta. The one dish she makes that we all quietly competitively chop away at, however, is this, although hers is of the beef variation. Only on New Year's day--a day observed as vegetarian to start out the year--do we do a meatless version. She'll even rise at 630am to make it to tuck into our daughters' school Thermoses, and then turn around the same evening and make it again. While she has never explained any family anecdote or history surrounding the dish, her silence and our furtive hoarding it onto our own plates suggest that it grounds her, and pleases everyone, much the same way it has you.

You won't find this there, I say, not like your grandmother makes, or your dad.  My own son was born in China, and every Saturday morning, I make him pancakes, like my dad did for me.

Score: 8 Another writer might have given us the story of how this dish came to be, since tomatoes came relatively recently (the blink of an eye in Chinese culture) from the Western Hemisphere.

Score: 7 I came to the US from China with my parents when I was just 6, and this is still one of my favorites dishes. It's so easy to make and it is such a staple in Chinese cuisine that no one really thinks twice about it but that's what makes it traditional. Definitely a recipe and worth bookmarking for use when my garden is filled with ripe Jersey tomato's. You can never have enough recipes for eggs.

Choose one: Expend manpower or ammo and chopper fuel. Look at YouTube of the Colonel in charge of Khe Sanh and you'll see the tactics. Yes, the NVA began a pullback before the Cav came in. We saw it develop in our briefings. They knew we were coming. You don't prep for something that big, move that many men and develop fire bases near Khe Sanh without it being pretty obvious. They had our SigInt. We had theirs. The NVA sent quite a few men from Khe Sanh south to attack our base camp and defer us from Khe Sanh. The 173rd was brought in to block them so we could do our work at Khe Sanh. A couple of smart things: We did false insertions to draw NVA artillery out of tunnels in KoRoc Mountain. The gunships took out the NVA artillery when they rolled them to the tunnel mouths. Showy? They were doing damage on our insertions. We stopped it. You can't do that on foot.

That buck sergeant was not. Score: 2 This moving piece touches me deeply. The willingness of the Vietnamese people to come together and welcome Americans after our protracted and gruesome war should be a valuable lesson for us. Our country desperately wants more of the Vietnamese's open-mind toward their former enemies. We badly need less of the hard-nosed tribalism that prevents us from living up to our country's motto: e Pluribus Unum Score: 6 Given that the US not only forgave Germany, Japan and Italy, but rebuilt and protected them, I hardly think the Vietnamese rank above us in the forgiveness category. Score: 2 yes, the Vietnamese people are very forgiving when it comes to the American war, as they call the Vietnam conflict. It it not pure generosity extended to a former enemy. It is primarily because they don\u00b4t want to look back on a war that was first and foremost an extended civil war between North and South Vietnam. Each part had its backers, the North with China and Russia, the South with the USA. But particularly the Vietnamese in the South, who had to suffer so much after being reunified by the North, remember the US as supporting their life and aiming for their freedom and independence. The legacy of that torn chapter in history is longer lasting in present Vietnamese minds than the war with and against the Americans. Because for over 20 years after the end of the war, it had won the war but lost the peace. Only the opening of the country in the early 90\u00b4s to the outside world opened a window to a better life for all again. Americans and other foreigners today in a way represent that open window. Which is one of the reasons why everyone is so forthcoming to foreign visitors and investors alike and don\u00b4t want to be reminded of past horrors. Score: 3 Yes, we forgave the fascist triad after World War II, as we should have. The American War in Vietnam was a different type of campaign. Whereas, the United States invaded Vietnam, interfering militarily in what was essentially a civil war, none of the Axis powers you cite actually invaded the United States. In Vietnam, we invaded, imposing our will upon all Vietnamese in the north and south, poisoned the country with defoliants, bombed religious monuments and culturally important cities while allowing American death squads (Tiger Force and others) to roam the countryside indiscriminately killing anything that moves. I served there and have been back to visit. Vietnam and her people are a wonderful example of the power of forgiveness.

BRAVO tells the story of Khe Sanh through stunning documentary footage of the siege and the Rodgers' extensive interviews with veterans of the siege. Not only individuals but history courses across the country will find it compelling. It is available from BravoTheProject.com Score: 2 It is a disgrace that the Marines were forced, by the rules of engagement, into a defensive posture at Khe Sanh instead of being able to engage the NVA who were free to cross borders back and forth into Laos and North Vietnam. When on a Khe Sanh mission, our reconnaissance aircraft freely crossed the Laotian border on our patrol route as did the strike aircraft dispensing aerial munitions. We went after the NVA no matter where they were but the Marines could only dig in and get pounded. Because LBJ demanded that Khe Sanh be held, we were told that we could not leave the Khe Sanh patrol route no matter what happened to the aircraft. On other missions over the Ho Chi Minh trail we had the discretion to abort the mission and did so if there were serious problems. It appears that LBJ did not want to get embarrassed by a loss at Khe Sanh no matter what happened to the Marines and to a lesser extent the Air Force. We need leaders who want to win if they put troops in a war and not be satisfied to simply avoid losing. Score: 21 I went through the siege on Hill 861 as the artillery forward observer ( FO) for Kilo 3/26. The Hill fights from the spring of '67 are not little remembered by any Marines I know. The general public might be different. Small point to make about the distance, but it is only 30 miles from the South China Sea to Khe Sanh and another 7 to the border with Laos. I went back in 2000 because it was finally possible to climb up to the hills, and I wanted to stand on 861 in order to pay my respects to 28 buddies who lost their lives there.

I bought the Maravich basketball shoes, that were too tight and hurt my feet, but I had to wear them because they were endorsed by Pete. He averaged 44 ppg for three straight years in college without the 3-point line or shot clock -- wow! Still the all-time collegiate leading scorer and he did it in three years. And he did it with style. My college roommate was fortunate to have seen him play when LSU came to Oregon to play Oregon State. He told me LSU ran on to the court for warm-ups and Maravich simply bounced the ball into the basket on his first warm-up layup. The crowd loved it. Another thing to note when considering the essay's concluding thought is that Maravich grew up the son of Press Maravich, a major-college basketball coach at Clemson, N.C. State and L.S.U. That, too, may have influenced the tenor of Pete's quest. Gold suede 2-stripe Pro Keds, flop-socks, bangs in yer face, basketball in hand at all times, even under the dinner table. Pete was our meta-hero, our Barishnikov of the Cow Palace, our template for 8th grade cool. ESPN did not exist when Pistol Pete played basketball. When network TV carried one of his games it was must watch TV. His wizardry was mesmerizing. For those that never had the pleasure of watching Maravich play, I suggest you watch some YOUTUBE clips. You will see things that the players of today only dream about doing. With all due respect to Magic Johnson and the SHOWTIME ERA, Pistol Pete was by far the most entertaining basketball player (college or pro) in the last 50 years. It was an absolute joy to watch him play. Score: 1.0 At our age the game should never be about the score. Only the beauty, fun or work out count Score: 0.0 Three more facts: He played in college before the shot clock. He was the only Top 50 pro player honored on the 50th anniversary of the NBA who had died. And, as my wife reminds me about my old-timers games, he died playing in a half-court pickup game. Score: 6.0 I remember Pistol Pete well - as an undergraduate at Ole Miss watching him, playing for LSU, elevate the game to a solo virtuoso performance (and his socks always fell down; the crowd would watch for it). Later, living in New Orleans, I watched him play for the Jazz - having seen Bob Cousy of the Celtics, and Oscar Robertson of Cincinnati, I thought that here we have a blending of of the two, with his own contribution of Cajun cayenne. We lived on the North Shore of Lake Pontchartrain at the time, and often, as I drove into work in the mornings, I would see Maravich in his black Porsche Carrera, casually cutting through traffic as though rehearsing moves for the game that night. Once or twice I would try to stay with him, but I fell for his jukes as if we were on the court. Maravich became active in Christian circles after his retirement, and was a frequent guest on several Christian radio programs. In fact, that's how I heard of his death: I was listening to a Christian program as I was driving to Lafayette, LA, and after it ended, James Dobson began his broadcast with the news of Maravich's death. I played a regular series of pick-up games with managers and crew of my various restaurants. Sometimes, like Swanson, Maravich's ghost would urge me on - to take the shot, to use a head fake, to flip that pass behind my back. There would be oohs from the guys. And my socks would fall down.

Pete's teammates were just as disciplined, they knew a pass could come anytime, from any angle. Today's players can't stay that focused. Regardless of the sport, when something truly audacious and sublime is created out of what seems like virtually nothing, will inevitably elicit a near universal reaction from a crowd; stunned silence, then a mountain of noise in recognition of it's greatness.

The British were defending property and their flank after the Japanese appeared ousted. The French plantation establishment felt Vietnam's loss as a monetary and personal loss. But the game had changed. Vietnamese people could easily mistake American intervention as interference in the birthing of nationhood.

However, he did not account for the possibility that the North's Allies would not advertise their distinction from the South's population for the GIs and that non-discriminating measures against those allies would push the population into supporting them, thus every Northern supporter who was eliminated led to increased support within the South for the North. What this proves is not that it was impossible to win in Vietnam. It proves that attrition of the North was not a viable way to bring victory. One man who realized this was Gen. Abrams who took over MACV shortly after the 1968 Tet Offensive. His approach was to frustrate Northern logistics (transport of materiel through Laos and Cambodia, and storage in the Southern jungles) and build support among the Southern population. Abrams' efforts led to the end of the Viet Cong as a fighting force, forcing the North to use its own regular forces during the 1972 Easter Offensive, forces which were vulnerable to American firepower. Score: 7 I believe that another reason the brass did not push back much on the subject of Vietnam was that it was their field opportunity in which to answer a question they had: Can US forces fight (and win) a brushfire wire, as opposed to a WWII type conflict? History seems to show that they weren't going to take no for an answer, any time soon. They threw more resources at the problem, myself and my fellow B52 crewmen included. Maybe not remembered enough, though. It would be nice if the current sitting president would be able to read. Maybe suggesting some readings from what we have learned from Vietnam and elsewhere.

Truman witnessed Roosevelt's mistake, and submitted to the unremitting pressure of Conservatives incapable of identifying with the problems of common people, let alone the peasants of Asia being ground by a rapidly changing world transiting from agricultural to industrial and technological in one fell swoop. Eisenhower by the time of Cuba had already betrayed so called American values when he blessed deadly coups in Iran and Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kennedy, despite his rhetorical idealism, came from privilege, was pressured by the same capitalist/corporate forces that pressured Truman and Eisenhower, and was ill informed regarding the full history of Vietnamese history, nationalism, and resistance to China. All of them failed to make the moral choice, as subsequently did Johnson. The common people were of concern to none of them.

Score: 0.0 Journalism is what allows people to bring light onto many subjects that may be in the dark. After reading this article, I proceeded to look at my school's newspaper. Despite being an avid reader and writer, I do not read the school newspaper due to the popular opinion that school's do not write about diverse matters. Upon looking at my school's newspaper, I saw a range of articles published, but an article like the students wrote could not be published. Many schools throughout the United States would not allow the tarnish of their reputation. Although creativity and innovation are encouraged, censorship is still definitely prominent. I commend the students for branching out, and this is due to the teachers who continue to motivate and the state who allows this type of freedom of expression. Social media advancements connect the world and allow people of all ages to have broader aspects on life. Therefore, this has permitted the rising of several significant journalistic investigations. However, I believe many high school students do not possess the same skill that the students from Pittsburg High School have. Regardless, there are students across the country who would want to voice their opinions and unfold information for their audience. In the end, I think that other states should pass laws like the Kansas Publication's act, giving students freedom to express and inform, but also giving these students the experience they need in the real world. As a member of my school's editorial team, I find it hard to publish stories that have the slightest possibility of staining the school's image. Wanted to write a piece that criticizes the school cafeteria---marked too controversial. Wanted to offer some suggestions to school policy---that didn't make the cut either. Not a single member of the school staff encouraged me from seeking the 'truth'. Everyone preferred to stay safe. The editorial staff of the Booster Redux were brave enough to 'speak truth to power' and in doing so, their work became commendable examples of solid journalism. yes they should My school's paper doesn't have prior review or restraint, thankfully. Our paper is completely student-run, and input from our adviser is more advice than it is definitive instruction we have to follow. There's currently no law statewide (to my knowledge) protecting student journalism; SB 5064 recently failed and was expected to do just that. Reading about the reporting the students at Pittsburgh High School conducted is empowering and encouraging, particularly because it makes me feel like the work I do actually does make a difference. The reporters were relentless and probing, which paid off. I think something like this could happen at my school, and that if it were to, our publication is strong enough to cover it. I agree with Rosentiel when he says significant journalistic investigations can come from anywhere. These students are living proof, and with the progression of digital media, significant journalism is accessible everywhere. Student journalists having autonomy over their stories leads to reporting like what The Booster Redux did. It leads to the truth. I don't understand why anyone wouldn't want the truth to come out, and naturally I'd like for more states to pass laws like what Kansas has. Student journalism is important. My school's paper has done stories on sexual assault, perceived school shooting threats later blown out of proportion, LGBTQ+ rights and gender/sexual identity. Our coverage was only possible due to lack of prior review/restraint. My school does not have a newspaper. I feel like we should have a newspaper because it can give us information on important things that we need to know about, it might give a student an idea of journalism as a career, and it can be a way for students to show their opinions to thoughts who would otherwise ignore them. In the text, it says \u201cFour days after students at a high school newspaper in Kansas published an article that questioned the credentials of a recently hired principal, she resigned. This shows a student who took their voice in the paper to show their opinion of an authority figure that would have been nothing to the public eye but now their voice shall be heard by all. In conclusion, I believe that a school newspaper would be an amazing incorporate in all schools. If it weren't for this law then a lot of people may be able to get jobs with false credentials, other states should push to get this law that way it could possibly prevent other problems such as this one. I think these students were brave and strong. It was a risky thing to go against there new school principle and question her, but it was the right thing to do. If these kids hadn't done this, they may have an unqualified principle running their school! Its truly shocking that the school hired her in the first place, and the students were the ones to fact check her credentials."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

As someone with a spouse born and raised in Germany, we've been looking for something more like what Mr. Hauck was trying. American versions of German restaurants seem to be a mixed bag. Certainly Mader's is very good, but many other restaurants either do the same old, same old, or overpower every dish with kraut/gravy and call it authentic. Ironic that a poster here speaks to the Americanizing of a menu. I've been to a number of German restaurants in the US with deep friend everything, including chicken wings.

I'm not going to mince words, this is sad. With all respect to Mr. Hauck, the changes were not to the good. The food and service were not up to the old standards, and the spartanizing of the decor seemed cheap. I think there were two options in saving Ratzsch's. One would have been to double down on what had worked. Mader's still packs them in. The other would have been to do more of a beer hall concept. If you wonder what that would have looked like, go to Munich. But the idea of Americanizing and spartanizing it while changing the recipes was not a good idea. I has the schnitzel before Christmas, and mine at home is better. I thank Chef Hauck for trying. Perhaps it was easier to let go seeing it fade for a year. Still, it's a sad event.

A dinner at the original place was always a special event, especially around the holidays. When it simplified itself and moved uptown into an office complex, it was a flop. The trick is to modernize the menu, but still keep the surroundings and the tastes that make the place special. There are some modern Austrian-German restaurants that do this well, to the point where I could even detect some of my grandmother's seasonings in some dishes (and confirmed by the chef). And from what I read in The Times, traditional German cuisine is alive and well in Brooklyn. So why not Milwaukee? Score: 2.0 Mr. Hauck took over a restaurant that may have been an institution forty or fifty years ago but had apparently been increasingly irrelevant and less profitable in more recent years. Mr. Hauck's approach might have been drastic; however, his renovations and menu changes were not the ultimate cause for Karl Ratsch's failure. Restaurants like Ratsch's fail because they fail to constantly adapt to changing demographics, tastes and economic realities. They fail because they foolishly adhere to an if it ain't broke, don't fix it mentality. If a chef/owner cannot look out onto a dining room floor and see a diverse and renewing clientele, his or her business is irreparably broken. This was Ratsch's fate. A similar fate awaits any restaurant that keeps the same unchanged decor and menu for decades. RIP Karl Ratsch's. What a shame. What killed Ratzsch's were ill conceived changes. Mader's is still packing them in. Score: 8.0 From reading comments here and the in the local Milwaukee media, I wonder how many of the dissenters actually went to the restaurant after Mr. Hauck made his changes? There were many traditional German dishes on the menu, and in the large portions that Milwaukeeans seem to still want.

Think about it this way. If we lived in a world where 100% of people had been vaccinated and the vaccine was 99.99999% effective, every case of the disease that still occurred would be in a previously vaccinated individual/a vaccine failure- ie, out of 103 cases, all 103 would be in previously vaccinated individuals, despite the fact that the vaccine was 99.99999% effective.

He let Neymar take a penalty recently because he hadn't scored in a while and need confidence. Messi celebrated as if he had scored the goal because he is the most generous team player ever. How does one say that Messi, Iniesta, and Suarez lost their mojo when each scored or had a hand in scoring? When stuff like this happens, I always think its a good idea for the men who call MLS games to recalibrate their praise for the likes of Jozy Altidore, et al. Messi and Neymar are like Secretariat and American Pharoah compared to Altidore, who's like old Tilly being led to the glue factory. it'll be kids like Pusilic who inspire the five year olds in America to become our Neymars and Messi. Score: 1 it is called TEAM work; so if Messi realized that Neymar could help the team win this crucial game, it shows great leadership on Messi's part. After all, a true team leader should act on the team's interest and not on the leader's own interest. Alas, this type of leadership is sorely missing nowadays in our politicians across most of the world. Bravo Messi and way to go Neymar; you have all won, and made many Barcelona fans very happy. Keep up the good work. Score: 0 The last three goals were magnificent - Naymar's free kick plus the astonishing cross to Roberto are the stuff of legend. Score: 1 Exceptional performance from Neymar. Interesting that Messi clearly didn't want the second penalty either (not that it should have been given in the first place. Suarez should have been sent off for a second bookable dive and that's the game over and all these articles about the greatest comeback every would have no place). Not sure why Mr. Smith calls out Beckham in the crass uneducated way that lots of writers too. It's almost like he pays for having such a high public profile. He was a top-drawer player by any yardstick - trophies, clubs, respects from his peers etc. When dropped at Real Madrid because of the pending move to LA it was his teammates who told Capello he had to come back into the team. Played for Manchester United, AC Milan, Real Madrid, PSG - yet gets called out by a writer for no reason at all. To write - a player of less natural talent than many of his Brazilian counterparts would have been a fairer statement. Score: 3 Not a dive. Marquinhos let Suarez get goalside of him and then drifted into the Uruguayan without looking. It's a penalty. As for Beckham, as good as he was, he was never the best player on his club or national team, not even the Galaxy. Score: 0 The goal in the film-clip is an obvious off-side. Barcelona had a 12th player; the referee. Score: 1 Sergi Roberto was not offside, another player was, but not active. Score: 0 There is no such thing as no-active off-side, only off-side when the player is behind defenders of the opposite team in front of the goalkeeper at the moment the ball was sent. By the way, two of the penalties for Barcelona are the referee's figment of mind, false decisions. Therefore the referee is punished to quit refereeing the Champions League by the UEFA, Score: 7 Why did he take the free kick? Because he's right footed and could score from there vs. the very left footed Messi that would only be sending a ball in from that angle. Then there was also that spectacular free kick Ney recently scored in La Liga. That's not a mystery at all. The more interesting question is why Ney took the pen not Messi? Messi and Ney have both been feeble from the spot in the past, but not this year. But, Messi has not dealt well with sudden death situations, whereas Ney has been clutch for Brazil and Santos. Ney is a gem. He has worked very hard this season, but sadly wasn't scoring. When he was in the top 3 for Ballon d'Or, Messi missed two months and Ney took most free kick and penalty duties. Once Messi came back, he was on the wing again. Much is said about diving. I don't think he is a flopper. He gets hacked down a lot and is the most fouled player in La Liga. He is too skilled and fast for even the best defenders in the world. He does fall sometimes, but I think he genuinely falls and gets upset with himself instead of looking for a pen. He also gets up despite all the fouls and falls and keeps on playing. You can't fault a perseverance. I am sure that 50% of Messi's free kicks and pens have come from fouls on Ney. Ney should get assists for those. But, he is committed to his teams, fans, family, and brand. If extras don't disrupt his play, so? Ney knows his place. Score: 0 Excellent article and good comment. Neymar is incredible and doesn't get credit for swallowing his pride and playing second fiddle to Messi. Messi has obviously been the best player in the world for almost a decade, but this year it has not been so clear. Messi has had a down year (although his goal-scoring numbers are still up) and Neymar has filled in a lot of the dynamism that Messi used to provide. But Neymar still defers to Messi, letting Messi continue to be the face of the team. On any other team in the world (except maybe Real Madrid), Neymar would be the undisputed #1. But he is biding his time into his mid-20s, which really speaks to his character and desire for winning. I also agree that Neymar isn't that much of a flopper. Sure, he makes a meal of it when he gets hacked down, writhing around like he was shot by a sniper. But he really gets hacked, more than any other player I've ever seen. It's clear that the scouting report is that Neymar can destroy you, so you should make him think twice by hurting him. And the refs generally allow it because of his reputation as a flopper. I'd say you haven't been watching matches if you think Messi has had a down year. He's saved the team time and time again, in games where Neymar and Suarez just seemed off. It's not just his goals, it's everything. He's played a deeper, covering for a faltering midfield, and still managed to score more goals than anyone in the league. Score: 1 PSG had a meltdown. They only managed to score one goal in a game where they were leading in points. Barcelona did well but PSG played terribly. Too much praise for the Catalans. PSG beat them 4 nil just a week ago, no? So what happened to the team? Score: 2 Messi is still the man, but as the motto states, it's more than a club and therefore more than just any one person. It is a TEAM sport and I think that this attempt to predict Messi's demise is in a word...lame. It's one game and Neymar has finally turned it on albeit late in the season. Score: 1 When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Well done Neymar! psg ..supposedly top players.on big salaries really collapsed.fans must be incredibly disappointed. Score: 15 Hard to know for sure what was going on between Messi and Neymar, but I suspect it is, as the author states, a case of selfless teamwork by Messi. He knew Neymar was on fire, and he has the strength of character to step aside and let him shine. Messi has done exactly what Neymar did -- grab the game by the scruff of the neck and bend it to his will -- soooo many times over the years, on the biggest stages in the sport. To see him recognize the same kind of magic in another player and be able to let him shine speaks volumes for the his self and the team. Visca Barca! Score: 1 Good teammates and teams feed the hot hand, or in this case the hot foot. Score: 10 Neymar had an excellent game, but Messi is still king at Camp Nou. He has been outstanding this season. Neymar will be the best one day, but not yet. Score: 4 what a performance!"", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Better impersonate another than be myself, since I am nobody being black, poor, unemployed, and forced to live by crime. The hero of Six Degrees of Separation, by John Guare, does not grow through his experiences with the family he cleverly fools, as does the narrator of Ralph Ellison's classic novel, Invisible Man, who is made to run in circles by those bent on destroying him. Ultimately, he withdraws from the world around him to be alone and to learn who he is. Guare's play could have been a masterpiece had it been built on the opposition between two kinds of frauds: that of the bourgeoisie and that of a feckless but bright and imaginative black youth trying to survive in a hostile world. Six Degrees clearly reflects the influence on its author of Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author and Henry IV. In the first, each of the characters knows his/her script, and in the second, the middle-aged man who tries to make people believe he is King Henry IV knows what he is supposed to say and do to resemble the King. But Guare's hero has to invent Paul Poitier's life as he goes along and respond to his interlocutors convincingly. The interaction between him and his mimicking the life of another for the sake of others who themselves feel estranged from the core of their being could make for powerful theater. Score: 3.0 Courtney B. Vance played Paul in the 1990 Broadway production and Stockard Channing is to the manor born, attending the prestigious Madeira School and then Radcliffe. Therefore, Ms. Janney is not closer to Ouisa\u2019s real-life counterparts than Ms. Channing was. Score: 4.0  McDaniel DID create Paul for the May 1990 off-Broadway premiere. Vance replaced him a couple of months later when it went into a Broadway designated house. Brantley didn't specify Broadway. Let's ALL get our facts straight. Score: 1.0 I saw the opening last night and thought the play was wonderful. Well acted (Hawkins was a particular star), well paced, and well staged. I agree with all the others commenters, the children are awful. They are very out of place in an otherwise well-oiled drama, and their histrionics were distracting and, quite frankly, stupid. Score: 0.0 Sure it's nice to see classics - if that's what this is - revived from time to time, but considering the number of exciting new work by women and playwrights of color that never get seen, I can't help thinking that it's a whole lot of money and talent that could have been put to far better use. Imagine the talents of Janney, Hickey, and Hawkins and the resources poured into this show being devoted to bringing the works of the voices that don't get heard to the Broadway stage? Maybe then it wouldn't take Broadway audiences decades to see the brilliant works of women like Nottage and Vogel. And maybe then it wouldn't be only women and writers of color who have to win Pulitzers and other major recognition in order to get their work produced on Broadway instead of the revivals and recycles that now take up space and eat up the limited amount of resources available for the arts. Nothing against Sixc Degrees in particular - but I have absolutely no doubt that Janney, Hickey, and Hawkins would be every bit as brilliant in many of the other plays waiting to be seen as well. Score: 2.0 I wonder if the play just isn't as relevant in 2017 as it was in 1990. Is it a bit dated? I read it around that time, and was blown away, but 27 years is a long time, and much has changed in our world, culture, etc. Score: 1.0 Like the author, the play is full of itself. Score: 2.0 What I remember from a local production of this play may not even have been intended by Mr. Guare: is he indicating just how ridiculous some of us liberals can be at times? Furthermore, where, oh, where, did their impossible kids learn to be so superficial and dangerous? I hated them on sight. They, in such a light piece, were riveting. However, this play, itself, is simply not much at all. Score: 9.0 It's a stunner; Stockard Channing's performance is devastating. Score: 3.0 Who cares about the friggin movie? This is a review for a STAGE production, not a movie. So it seems kind of obvious that any comparisons of this revival should be made to prior stage productions and not any movie. Score: 9.0 I thought Brantley enjoyed the play until the odd throw-away line at the end that it's a less than ideal production. Corey Hawkins really shines! I didn't know him and now can't wait to see him in another show. Allison Janney perfectly balanced her skepticism with her desire to help Paul Poitier. JB Hickey was so natural as the art dealer and his struggles to close a sale. The children were way over the top - it was not only distracting, it was frankly annoying. It was in no sense funny, as it was intended to be. The set was warm and inviting. You wanted to join them on stage. Loved the Tiepolo book on the coffee table. Good touch. Never saw the original production. I really enjoyed this one overall and would strongly recommend it. Score: 7.0 I'm afraid I found this review not very helpful. Mr. Brantley keeps inferring that the production is barely just OK, if that. But the only place where he actually gives any clue as to why is that the farcical elements of the Park Avenue crowd's deception is heightened at the expense of poignancy, a tone that screeches as the play becomes darker. Score: 24.0 I wish Brantley was more clear in what makes this play a less than ideal production. Score: 11.0 Once again a name recognition play which was relevant 20 years ago is hauled out to be produced. Yes, the drama can be effective but its vision is somewhat passe. This play can't disguise the fact that theater takes so long to produce it becomes like old quarts of milk left out. Can we not see plays fasterwhich haven't garnered raves in London first or are composed by already well known dramatists. The theater becomes more & more like a dinosaur mafia. This is because the coverage of theater in what used to be the theater center of the world is so sparse. The Times Arts section on some Sundays is like a slim brochure. Off Off Broadway is never taken seriously. It seems this reductive, dismissive & diminishing stance on theater arts when we need them most signals a triumph of apple pie facism. Score: 10.0 There are plenty of new plays, on and off-Broadway, if you'd care to look. Broadway has always done a lot of revivals. This play is as close to a contemporary classic as any from the past few decades, and is well worth a first-rate revival. Score: 16.0 I left this play feeling very unsatisfied, yet not sure why. Your comment, a less than ideal production, begs clarification. Score: 0.0 I felt the same way, and I also can't put my finger on it. Score: 17.0 Even an esteemed and estimable critic could profit from a little blue penciling by a skilled editor, and this is proof positive of that. one which leaves the average - and certainly the discriminating - viewer hungry a half-hour after the curtain drops? A good theater review should not be a treasure hunt where you have to hunt for clues as to how this production differs from the one 25 years ago. And you certainly should not find yourself sandbagged by a final sentence with the words you won't see in the ads - a less than ideal production - when the too many words that go before suggest that a skilled director has looked for AND FOUND a way to make the play stay piping hot. For my part - and I won't pretend that I remember the L.C. production I saw half a lifetime ago Yes, it's VERY briskly paced, but when the spotlight isn't on the Kandinsky, it's on the tragedy that the best and the brightest focus on making a sale or worrying about a favorite shirt with hardly a thought as to the 99.999% of the world off upper Fifth Ave. ... so that a charlatan even greater than Paul can come to occupy the White House. Score: 2.0 Brantley mentioned Ouisa's costumes. Parts -- her shoes and stockings, the palazzo pants - were spot on, but both dresses, particularly the black gown, were closer to what Paul would have imagined for a society matron. Both were cheap and not at all what Ouisa would have worn then or now. A nit, but one that irked when I saw it a few weeks ago. Score: 10.0 Mr. Brantley's reference to James McDaniel implies that Mr. McDaniel was the sole actor who played the part of Paul throughout the original run. It's true that James McDaniel played Paul in the play's initial off-Broadway run at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater which opened in June, 1990. It should be noted, however, that when the play moved upstairs to the Vivan Beaumont Theatre in November of 1990, Courtney B. Vance took over the role. Score: 6.0 I saw the show in previews a while back. Allison Janney was rock solid and Corey Hawkins made you believe a profoundly needy young man of the streets was at the same time a brilliant, seamless psychopathic con man who excels at seducing others in various ways. However, the play did not work for me in two ways. One, the offspring of the couple were so cartoonish and slapstick that their contrast to the needy con man who wanted so badly to be a part of their world was lost to cheap gags. Two, the playwright's attempts to connect art with life made me think of papers we all write in college English and Art classes that are full of high falutin vague nonsense that are really just personal flights of fancy. And the business about 'six degrees of separation' seemed a concept slapped and forced onto the play for some attention grabbing purposes rather than any real, substantive meaning. If you are a fan of Allison Janney this is certainly a performance of hers you will not want to miss. And as Mr. Brantley points out, Corey Hawkins is a revelation. His performance makes you ponder over and over again long after you have seen the show as to what makes his character really tick. Score: 8.0 Corey Hawkins was mesmerizing the whole time he was on the stage. so irritatingly over-the-top and simplistic.

His past speaks for itself. He--and the FBI director, and possibly the Russians are why we have arrived at this ParlourSteakandFish state. However, President Obama's failure to speak up against the latter two probably played a greater role than McMullen's candidacy did.

Super Bowl Sunday's are my favorite because I get to sit down with my family and have a friendly competition on who's going to win that years Super Bowl. I also enjoy the food my mom makes. I was hoping for the Patriots to win and in the end they came through. The 2-point conversion blew my mind, it was definitely a game-changing play. The first half had me thinking that the Falcons were going to win but in the end the Patriots came through. Although I fell asleep during Halftime, I heard it was amazing. I love watching the super bowl. It brings Americans together and puts aside our problems and differences. No matter what race, religion, where home is, what team you are going for, or what candidate you went for, you will be brought together with your fellow Americans to watch the super bowl. The reason i like it is the commercials and the game. Although the commercials weren't as funny as some previous years. The half-time shows are what draw the attention of many people You never know what is going to happen and most of the artists who do it a freaks. I always like the half-time shows and the commercials because they are really funny and fun to watch. I like that President Bush flipped the coin in the beginning of the game I thought that was really cool. I also cant believe that the Patriots came in with that clutch in the over time. Everyone that I was with wanted the Falcons to win because they are kind of like the underdogs. When one of the Patriots player missed the ball , he dove for it, then when it hit the Falcon players leg he caught it. But he wouldn't have caught the ball if it dint hit the players leg because it would have hit the ground. I am not exactly a football fan, but I enjoy watching the Super Bowl. I did watch the Super Bowl this Sunday and it was a great game. At first i thought the Falcons were going to win because before the halftime show they were doing great they had a 21-3 lead. It was pretty funny because one player on the Falcons and one player on the Patriots got their helmets stuck together. I personally don't understand how on earth that happened, but it did. After Lady Gaga's halftime show the Patriots came up from the bottom and right at the end tied with the Falcons which caused it to go into over time. Then unexpectedly the Patriots scored a touchdown making them win the Superbowl 51. I am not exactly a football fan, but the Superbowl was great. The best part of the Super Bowl is all the food! I like to sit with my family, watch a little bit of football, and eat food! I thought that the Patriots would win because I knew that they have a really good defense. One more great part about the Super Bowl is spending time with all of my family. The best part of the Super Bowl is all the food! I believe that the Atlanta Falcons should win. But after watching last nights game I understand why they didn't. The play calling towards the end of the game was awful. They had been running the ball down new Englands throat all game. the first play from scrimmage for Atlanta was a 39 yard scamper from Devonta Freeman. You mix that with some faith, Trust, and Pixiedust, from the G.O.A.T Tom Brady and thats how you make a Comeback Stew. I believe the Patriots will win because they have one of the best defenses in the NFL and I believe that offense wins games, but defense wins championships."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed between Canada and the U.S. only. Canada had to give up a great deal to get the dispute settlement mechanism. Without it, Canada would have been at the mercy of U.S. trade politics. Once the FTA was signed, within a year or two, Ontario's manufacturing sector was gutted as American branch plants closed and Canadian owned companies fled south to relocate in states with low standards and taxes. Ontario has never fully recovered. After the FTA, the U.S. was to Canada then as Mexico is to the U.S. now, a place with low wages and standards where products could be made more cheaply. I wish someone in the U.S. media would stand up and challenge Trummp's assertion that the U.S. suffered at the hands of Canada during the NAFTA negotiations as that is patently ridiculous. Canada had to give up much for access to the U.S. market and there are days when I think it was not worth the cost. Score: 10 I believe this episode with cast a longer shadow than just an ugly negotiation. It has long been that Canadas raw goods go to the US for manufacturing or other use. Our wood and oil and natural gas are prime examples. America doesn't like our forest company's efficiently. So they put duties on them years ago. Now more than half the forest products of BC go to the Asian pacific. This is a good example of what needs to happen with the rest of our home grown industry. I think as Canadians we are little bit sick of getting wholesale price for our goods while America charges retail. A good example is the new LNG industry in the US. Our natural gas could be exported off our abundant tidewater to overseas markets in Europe and the Far East. It has turned into a tolling program with American exporters where Canadian gas has to cross the border to find a market. Canada gets wholesale and America gets retail. The free trade agreement was supposed to level the playing field for American and Canadian company's to compete for the betterment of all. It seems our American counterparts believe the betterment of all means the betterment of them exclusively. The angst felt among my peers on this side of the border seems to stem from this lack of fairness on the part of the US.

Trade agreements are designed largely to support these arrangements. When the agreements include exceptions to free trade, those exceptions are designed to protect local interests from competition in whatever country insists they be included. The agreements always cause there to be winners and losers. They almost never include measures to assist the losers to re-deploy themselves, except to provide for delayed phase-in of the new provisions. This is the most fundamental weakness of these agreements and is leading to their demise from protectionist forces. The agreements usually also include a range of provisions governing patents, services, freedom of movement and freedom to make certain laws and rules. While these provisions seldom make the headlines they can be the most contentious aspects of negotiations. No agreement is a 100% win for all parties, but evidence would suggest that on the whole our countries are better off with NAFTA than without it. It is about 25 years old now, so undoubtedly changes may be appropriate. They should be negotiated in good faith. Prime Minister Trudeau is correct that a bad agreement is worse than no agreement. Interesting that you're showcasing opinions of people who are mostly in their 60s and 70s and not people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who may be more affected by the dissolution of NAFTA.

The people handling these issues have been doing so for very many years and they have thick skins. Hillary Clinton also lashed out against NAFTA during the campaign so one way this was going to be an issue. The going philosophy, which makes sense, is to keep talking and keep making the best of it. Europe and the Pacific will not be able to replace the Canada-US economic relationship for a very long time to come, even though it can and should grow substantially. Canada should have been diversifying its international economic relationships to a much greater extent than it has, notwithstanding that the arguments for doing so go back to the 1960s.

This is not a good thing to do, for the following reason: If you leave the baby attached it gets from the placenta, as long as the cord continues to pulsate throughout its entire length, the equivalent of one or two blood transfusions (50-200cc.).

I\u2019m proud of how midwifery has led the way, but I also value the life-saving advances of modern medicine. When you criticize \u201cevery last aspect of obstetrics that deviates from human evolutionary practice,\u201d are you suggesting we not intervene to save women and babies? We thankfully don\u2019t see it much in high-income countries, but too many women and newborns around the world still die because they lack the care we take for granted. This does not excuse the real problem of obstetric over-intervention or invalidate the beauty of natural birth, but if we don\u2019t recognize the real risks of childbirth and respect the skills of obstetricians, we are doing a disservice to women.

Early cord clamping/cutting coincided with women who were heavily medicated during labor and gave birth to medically depressed babies who needed stimulation and sometimes resuscitation. With so many women opting for natural birth or epidurals, this is no longer an issue. When my grand daughter was born, she got some meconium in her respiratory tract. They did not cut the cord until 5 minutes after birth, and then began clearing her airway. She pinked up quickly, and stayed pink during the procedures. 25 minutes later, still grunting a little, she was laid on her mother's abdomen, and within 10 minutes began breastfeeding. There was no more grunting or any indication of any respiratory problem after that point. One of the nursery nurses was advocating taking her to the NICU for obsevation, but thankfully the other nurse was recently certified as a midwife and understood the benefits of delayed cord clamping and skin to skin contact with the mother.

There's probably a good reason why she does a slow shut-down on the child's primary coupling, the umbilical, to the mother.

She came back (in what seemed like forever) but probably in reality, five or ten minutes later, with my son crying like a newborn. For the first two years he was a difficult baby, to say the least. At two years he was diagnosed with autism. He's now ten (still autistic). If a baby is still able to get oxygen from the placenta when the cord has not yet been cut, why cut it if the baby can't breath on his own yet? Why not set up the suction machine right next to the bed, where the baby could still be attached to the cord? Could my son's brain have been deprived of oxygen in that five or ten minutes that he was out of the room getting suctioned?

Score: 79 When I was training as a midwife, decades ago, we were told to allow the cord to stop beating before cutting it. This was not only to allow blood to continue to flow into the baby from the still attached placenta, but also, and probably more importantly, to insure adequate oxygen levels, especially if there was any delay in the infant breathing. The cord stops functioning on its own when the baby no longer needs it for life support. Considering the benefit to blood and oxygen, I find it astonishing, in a bad way, that anyone would cut the cord so quickly. What is the big rush? Score: 8 I had the experience as a doctor and a naturalist to assist in home deliveries.

Score: 0 Climate change is one of the most serious problems threatening our world today, and President Trump and his administration needs to treat it like such. More work needs to be done to reduce emissions and move to cleaner methods of power. The US government needs to do all it can do help the solar and wind power industries grow. If climate change is not slowed down, we can face drastic consequences. We should not wait until our coastal cities are destroyed to do something about this issue. President Trump and all other world leaders have a responsibility to the people of the world to help the planet. Overall, President Trump, his supporters, and his cabinet members should be more open to environmental issues and their solutions. There is a distinguishable group of individuals in our country and government that actively oppose many environmental initiatives proposed in order to decrease our environmental footprint as a nation. Although these are opinions and should be respected, it seems as though the priorities of these individuals are based more around business than the well being of the planet. President Trump and politicians should take a higher focus on the state of the environment and climate change, consulting with scientists and staying up-to-date on developments, in order to ensure that the planet that we call home remains healthy and sustainable. This is imperative because, while businesses and companies can evolve and change their practices over time, we only have one chance to preserve our environment. Though it may be more difficult and taxing for companies to change their policies and methods, it would negatively reflect on us as a society if we let our own environment deteriorate because it is easier than addressing the issue. As citizens of the United States and as beings on this planet, we should all follow developments in environmental policy because no matter our differences as people, the one thing we all have in common is our dependency on the environment. In my opinion i think Mr Trump should have more considerations about the climate change problems that affecting the world on every aspect,especially in the domain of health, pollution. If i was president i will not only agree with the clean power plan but also reinforce the rules by creating a specifically unit of control over the population and also the companies in order to reduce pollution in the world. i'll will make sure those companies and factories use 50% of energy solar by following my policy . If I was president, the most things I would do about Climate Change. Adopt to energy saving make it habit to turn off the lights as you leave room, and turn off your computer and unplug electronics when they are not in use. Plants trees to protect my environment. Change the way about transportation work or bike whenever possible. Score: 1 If I was President, climate change is one of the first things I would create new areas and built more industries. This way can help to avoid pollution, reuse and recycle some projects. In my opinion climate change needs to clean each area by sweeping and washing the streets, increase some more dustbins in the subways, parks so the environment can make climate change with fresh air. Reforestation is an important part too so climate change. I think if I could be a president then I will do first my lifestyle greener because everything we do in our day to day lives emits CO2 into the atmosphere. That means that even making small changes in what we do or how we do it? We can have a positive impact in preventing the onset of climate change. I think that president Trump is careful about climate change because he has big of priority. Now we are beginning to feel the effect of climate change around the global. While we can't undo the damage caused to the environment, we can help decelerate the rate of change and long term. change the fate of the planet altogether. Half the problem for us as individuals, However, is the knowing where to start. Score: 0 Climate change has been affecting catastrophically our mother nature for many years. Global warming is accelerating on an uncontrolled ways that life in our planet is being put in danger. As we can observe, every day nature is revolting more and more. We can see hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanoes, and etc. It is destroying all that it finds in its path. Human hands are contaminating the planet with all the inventions that come on his mind. We invent beneficial things, but at the same time, a double-edged sword that is affecting us all in an uncontrollable way. If I were president, I would take this very serious. I would make an emergency call to meet with all the great nations to look for a solution to this problem. I would create alternative energy, not to extract the oil from the earth, for the reason that this is the blood of the planet earth. The planet is crying itself, which is the way it can express itself. This way it does not contaminate the planet. In my opinion, of course, one of the priorities of each president is the environment. as this is deteriorated and with serious problems of changes because of us. It is the responsibility of the presiente to encourage and if it is possible to force the inhabitants of their country to care and make aware about the environment and possible consequences that can be caused. If I were president this would be a serious of my first actions. I would put a law where recycling would be mandatory, as in Europe, throw garbage to the street would give high fines, planting trees would be mandatory , the inspection would be strict with the companies of the pollution that they generate. The problem and the environmental changes are a matter of urgency and special attention because if the high commanders do not pay attention we won\u2019t know what serious consequences can have on our planet in the future. If I was president the first things is call the people to change their way of thinking because the climate change is real. Make aware like recycling and uses the solar energy. Warning they need to do studies and campaigns to diminish the causes and factors that most contaminate the earth for example CO2. Also find new ideas diminish global warning. In my opinion if I would be president what and how I can change climate. At first I would make a plan what I to do, how to apply and what I have to do to make it happen. Secondly I encourage people to save energy, implant huge amount of trees and make transportation choice like riding bicycles and clean your house as like recycle waste metal and others things. As a president is very important because he can encourage and support to do everyone healthy life\u2019s. And also encouraging people to clean their air conditioner filter and install energy efficient showerhead, replace tube light or bulb which are save energy power. So if I president I do all of these because for your health and future generation. However we are all responsible for our health, food, fresh water and fresh environment .so if we all so do this in our life everyday it would be neat and clean environment climate. If I where president of the United States, in order to address climate change, I would see to it that all neighborhoods no matter how small received recycling and compost cans, solar panel prices lowered, and a limit put to the number of trees cut down per year. If all neighborhoods received recycling and compost cans would dramatically change the amount of trash put into landfills. If solar panel prices were lowered then more people would buy solar panels for their homes, therefore reducing the supply and demand for coal burning. Last but not least a limit put to the number of trees cut down per-year would allow the cleaning of the air. I would like to see additional studies regarding climate change being done over the next four years in order to clarify that what is being released into the environment is and will be affecting us. If I was president, the first thing I would do is create a plan to reduce pollution. This is our only planet, and if we want to survive for as long as we can, we need to take care of our home. In my opinion, we should start with fossil fuel burning vehicles. Encourage citizens to switch to an eco-friendly car, and even better, to ride bicycles. Our attention should be directed towards reducing, recycling and reusing. At the crack of dawn once every week, a built trash man with a determined attitude aggressively snags your trash out of your front yard. He throws it into the truck where it takes the trash to be buried. Environments are frequently being destroyed by businesses for the sake of money. As Bernie Sanders said, \u201cI see a future where getting to work or to school or to the store does not have to cause pollution.\u201d Every day we see how the pollution takes over the environment, people throwing trash everywhere; big companies with pipelines leaking over the sea; people cutting the trees, and the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission contaminating the air. I think the first step to stop this big problem is become aware of what we are doing to the environment, if nobody doesn\u2019t care about it, who will care? There is rules and regulations already this is not the problem, the problem is to make the citizens follow all of them. So, if I was president, I would take some prevention measures such as: put a penalty fee for everyone who throw trash and be caught on the spot,would create an initiative to plant more trees. On the other hand, it is painful how we destroy our environment where we live. In my opinion we should all give our attention to the climate change. As a human being it's really important for us to take care our environment because we are the first, who responsible for pullute our environment. The president have to give most priority to the climate change and have to encourage people to reduce, recycle and reuse. Also the president should enforce and keep the clean power plan so that we can have more clean energy. Climate change is the greatest long term threat facing the world. If I became the president, I would take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as the reduction and conservation of oil, gas, and coal, the fossil fuels that are used in transportation, heating and cooling, agriculture, and electricity generation. Replacing carbon-intensive fuels with renewable and alternative energy sources is key to the current energy infrastructure, which will require transforming the global economy that is currently fueled primarily by carbon-based energy sources. I will encourage people to use recyclable and reusable packing material when shopping instead of non-recyclable. Leave the car at home if people can walk to the nearest place. Insulate at home, clean the air conditioner filters and install energy efficient shower heads. I will encourage people to plant more trees towards saving our environment. I would do seminars where I tell people how they can protect the climate by themselves. People and animals in many part of the world do not have clean and safe water to drink. As many more regions are hit by the drought, this problem will become even more serious. The sooner we start conserving water, the better off we all will be. I would focus on inventing new technologies to fight against climate change. The best way to solve the problem of climate change is to not depend on oil, gas coal and fossil fuels but to provide natural renewable energy sources. If I would be a president first of all I would control population problem and courage the people advantages of small family. would aware people use energy efficient products, Stop more factory establish. I would encourage people reduce reuse and recycle, plastic, bootless polyethen ,cans garbage in right place. Therefore by seminar and leaflet I would encourage people usefulness of tree plantation, harmful of deforestation. About food I will support people eat organic and locally grown food, grow some of our own foods. I would motivate people instead of your car use bike or bicycle. , however, motivate people give support and donate, many organization are working hard on solution change rely on financial support from citizen like you. Raising sea level, Global warming, Eco-system change are responsible for climate change. If we will unable to save climate change that will be a great threat for our future generation. It's a potentially disastrous reality that's already starting to have effect that are expected to worsen, experts say. Longer summers and heavier rainfalls are some of the impacts that already we are watching. First, we can't stop Climate change immediately but we can help to change climate. If I would be president, I would use the education to give everyone right information about climate. I will say all people to changing their own behavior to improve our climate change. The clean power plan is important for climate change. Increasing the energy efficiency of our house and office, driving less and try to walk or bike, planting more trees,reduce and reuse the recycle, installed solar system etcetera. Those are lot of things we can do ourselves. Those might look like small things, but those are powerful things to change the climate. I think that President Trump and other leaders should worry a lot because Climate change is something that affects all of us. In my opinion,if everyone work together we can make a good planet. Climate change should be a top priority. For President Trump and also every other people, because it affects all of us and the earth we live in. If we don't take care of our earth the things we need and use from it won't last for the future. I think we all as humans can help to make the earth better and cleaner. We can do this by cleaning up trash and recycling and finding ways to use less machines that produce too much carbon dioxide. Also, Mr Trump alone can't make all the changes by himself, we as a country have to also do little things to better the places we live around. Climate change is a serious problem in the world that is hitting worldwide. Every human should take responsibility for causing climate change and global warming. We play a major role in slowing climate change. President Donald Trump and the world leaders take that matter very seriously and have set regulations such as Clean Air Act which requires reduce carbon dioxide or to improve low-carbon energy technologies. We can join together today to protect the planet for future generations. It's a potentially disastrous reality that's already starting to have effect that are expected to worsen, experts say. Longer summers and heavier rainfalls are some of the impacts that already we are watching. First, we can't stop Climate change immediately but we can help to change climate. If I would be president, I would use the education to give everyone right information about climate. I will say all people to changing their own behavior to improve our climate change.

I think that President Trump and other leaders should worry a lot because Climate change is something that affects all of us. In my opinion,if everyone work together we can make a good planet. In my opinion we should take better care of our planet. We can do this by sowing more trees and avoiding contamination. Climate change should be one of the top priorities for the President because the planet must be taken care of. Now there is nothing new to help climate change and the world need of that In my opinion climate change is very important. I think Mr. Trump should pay more attention to that because some areas are so polluted. On the other hand, I also think that we as human being can help him to take care of our nation by recycling glass or metal, planting trees and conserving energy. Finally, Mr. Trump should keep, enforce, and defend the Clean Power Plan. In the world climate change is a big problem. Since human being had created machines that use carbon dioxide, climate change have become a big problem. In the world all human beings, we are the only one that can\u2019t try to solve this problem that effect everyone even if you do see it. If I were a president I were get rid of it of machines because we are in a period that technology is one of the main thing and we have technology to solve this problem. In my opinion the clean power plan is very important for us because through this program we can save energy. Is very important because if our environment is in good condition (has no pollution) we will live more years but we will not be able to live for a long time. We live by air, water and food. I did a pretty good job protecting our environment. I will see it to be informed and give my opinion if it is doing trump or not and try to do something to help the environment. Climate Change is big problem over the world that we need to take with responsibility. If, I were a President I would focus in this topic because is very important to preserve the existence of all livings things. I would use the media radio, TV and Internet for show the community how our world is dying from environmental pollution, and encourage the population to recycle, save energy, water, use the cars just when is necessary also I would implement regulation to companies that produce a lot of pollution . This Climate Change would be change if all we work together. I think we should try to reduce pollution by making the industrial plants reduce the pollution in addition to the chemicals that are dangerous to the environment, such as oil spills at sea. These are one of the most important factors besides we must continue to conserve our population that while we damage our environment we are killing every day the future of our planet. The clime change an important problem don\u2019t only for the president of the USA but also for other world leaders because is responsibility of everyone have to the preservation of the good planet. If they have the opportunity to do something to end climate change. In my opinion in order to help the climate we must begin to make changes, not only say that it is wrong if we do not help our planet with better climate change then they do nothing to help we must unite and help us all. I think that President Trump should worry a lot because it is something that affects us all as our president that he is, must care for and advocate for all, Climate change is something that affects us all and other leaders should also worry about problems And everything that happens with climate change. I think we all deserve respect and respect is something that is earned if you do not treat us with respect respect is a very important basis in life since respect is also based on the education and discipline that we are given. If I have the opportunity to do something to end climate change, I star with of implementation of rules stronger because in this moment many people know about this problem. But they can do anything for help to change the clime for this reason I think in this moment we have this problem because the lack of awareness and of desire to help our planet. My rules will be based in to help to awareness this people don\u2019t want to help the planet but this people would to work in project with objective is to care the planet. On the other hand, I think trump and other world leaders should put in their plan of governments a plan to help improve the environment because they can\u2019t say what we don\u2019t have problem with our planet because the last years we have more change about climate and they never to forgot which are example follow."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

The surprising thing was when another lady had actually jumped backgrounds which had completely blown my mind because that is the one thing that I would have never done. The messages that I took away from this film is that age is just a number and it does not really have anything to do with the amount of bravery you have or the lack thereof and that sometimes the human mind can overthink things that seem scary, but in the end if you finally decide to take the leap it would end up being not scary that at all, but instead might end up actually being pretty enjoyable. This film shows lots of people attempting to take a 30-foot dive into an olympic pool. Some people take the 30-foot dive but others are just too scared to take it. One woman was about to take the jump, but she quickly came back and got off the diving board. Another woman got off the diving board and then came back, but she never dived into the pool. I would feel very scared if I was attempting this 30-foot dive. Just by looking down 30 feet from above, makes your stomach sank down. Once you have taken the dive you probably won't be scared of doing it again, because you already know how it felt like. Live life to the fullest is an expression commonly used to encourage people to go beyond their limit and experience new things. Maximilien Van Aertryck and Axel Danielson did a short film on people encouraging themselves to go beyond their limits and experience a 30 foot jump off a diving board. As many people could not encourage themselves to jump off the diving board. Others encourage themselves to go beyond the limit and jump, however it took them some time to finally decide to jump. For example, the boy with the girl was scared to jump but slowly the girl persuade the boy to jump off the diving board. To add on many people felt challenged to jump off the diving board, however they were given the decision to chicken out which was a challenge because it's embarrassing to climb down the ladder. For example, the two boys on the diving board one with pony tail gave the other boy the choice to chicken out since the boy was to scared to jump however the boy was embarrass to chicken out because everyone was waiting on him to jump and an younger kid plus 70 year old women have attempted the jump. If I was given the chance to jump of the 30 foot diving board I would totally do it with a friend, it would be a new fun experience. Score: 1 This film was about divers attempting to dive down a 30 foot diving board. People of all ages decide to dive off the board, and some decide not to. It amazed me in the film that the elderly people had more courage to dive off the board than all the younger people. I personally would need lots of convincing to even attempt to do this, I eventually will jump off the board, but I wouldn't casually jump off without any hesitation. I believe that the film was made with the message that, being scared is natural when you are face to face with a fear, but you need to overcome your fear without overthinking the situation. Score: 0 In this film the swimmers were attempting to dive down a thirty feet diving tower when they reached the top they realized it was higher then it looked from ground level. Certain swimmers actually did jump but they had to convince themselves of it. I know personally I would never jump into a pool from that high because there is no guarantee that the fall is going to be pleasant when you get close to the pool. It was very interesting to see the reactions of the divers. In the film when you see the height from the diving board to the pool it does not look that dangerous. However, when I see all of these people backing down from doing it and taking a really long time to jump it makes you wonder. For instance I would definitely try this because I love heights, but I have never actually experienced this for myself in person, so I might change my mind. What interested me was how some people decided to jump together instead of individually. I myself would have done it by myself because my only fear about this would be having another person jump on top of me. These people are brave and courageous, even if they did not follow through with it. It is very interesting to see how people ended up convincing themselves to jump and how in some pairs one had to wait for the other to jump first and even then they were hesitant. I was surprised that the older woman was able to jump even though many others younger than her I am much like her in that we would have both been disappointed in ourselves if we did not jump. You could tell that each successful jumper was terrified because they did not even jump off, their knees grew weak and did not push them off the tower, instead, they fell. I would like to think that I have enough courage to jump off of a 10-meter diving tower but we will never know until I am out to the test. The film begin with people standing on top of a 10 meter diving tower. The people are weighing their options about whether it is worth the risk to jump. Most seem to be debating internally before giving up, they often try to stall for some time by stating what they are planning to do but don\u2019t actually go through with it. The thing that stood out to me was how when people see another person fall first and is safe, they are still hesitant. I was surprised when the elderly woman came back on the diving tower and jumped after she decide to give up, while many people younger than her was too afraid to jump. I would never jump off a diving tower that high, the people who jumped must have a lot of courage to be able to convince themselves to leap off. The message I can take away from this film is sometime you need to overcome your fear and not overthink. I feel that I am in the same boat as the people who took their time to complete the task. I feel that I would need some slight encouragement to convince myself to take the risk, but after some contemplation I would eventually convince myself to just do it. I feel that this task stands as a metaphor for daily life of how we can either face our fears head on with some encouragement or we can just chicken out and let fear consume us. I think this video also emphasizes the concept peer pressure, in the cases in which we see that someone else does something and we assume that it must be okay. I was surprised to see how long it took people to convince themselves to jump. This video breaks apart what you would typically perceive of people. Many commenters are surprised by the old woman, as was I. This just shows that you never know what to expect from anyone. You are never sure where any persons boundaries are and who is willing to push boundaries at all. You could have more in common in this way with an eighty year old woman than someone your age doing this. It's amazing what you learn in this video. I agree that the people who jumped off the diving tower in the film can be unexpected. The elderly woman sudden decision to leap off surprised me because she started walking down the ladder and most people younger than her did not have the courage to jump. It did change the way I see people because it show how human assumptions of people can be inaccurate. A person character is revealed in extreme conditions, people cannot be judge by their appearance. Even though the old woman was afraid of the height, she did not let it stop her. Everyone weighed the risks and hesitate while standing on the diving tower but some of the people who back down appear to be very fit which contradict the idea that younger and stronger people who be more likely to jump. Lots of people get very scared when attempting to take a 30-foot dive into a pool. I was also very surprised at the 70 year-old lady who took the 30-foot dive into the olympic pool. This video shows the viewers that they should not be scared of heights or anything else. People have to overcome their fears, so in the future people won't have to be dealing with those fears. Some men in the video did not attempt to take the dive, when I thought they were. One lady wanted to take the jump only if her husband did so. I do not know if I could do this right away I'm not one of those people who can do things that involve heights right away and if I do it's usually because I have a sudden burst of self-confidence . Then when I get to the point of realization for what I have done and have to finish the job I get scared and start thinking why did I do that? I start to panic. How I decide to jump in life is when I get a push or when I am on the brink of going crazy so I get myself out of so much thinking about it and actually do it to get it over with. For me, I think I find myself with a friend pushing me so much in order to overcome the fear of the jump. Literally, I would need a friend to push me so that I can accomplish that 10 meter dive. It's kind of like the guy in the video with Frida who jumped because he thought that his friend was gonna jump with him. I personally would've probably gone through the same experience that the older woman did. I would've HAD to jump off or I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Like the other people in the video, it would probably take awhile to convince myself to do it, but ultimately, knowing myself, I probably would've done it. I agree with you because I have experienced something like this before. At a party, I got to try trapeze and it took me some time before I made the first jump but after that it was thrilling. I would have definitely regretted my decision if I had not done the trapeze and if I had been given the chance to jump off a 10-meter diving tower, I would do it. I would also have to take a few moments to get in the zone, much like the boy who was on the tower with his sister who tuned out her voice in order to think, but I would have definitely done it as well. After all, life is about living isn't it? I agree , it would have taken me a while to decide to jump, but I would have definitely chosen to jump in the end because people really do only live once and why not jump off a really tall diving board while you are at it. But I would probably have jumped off with my eyes closed first and then do the challenge of just jumping. But by the third or fifth time around I would probably be trying to do a whole bunch of cool spins on my way down. And as the article says if I maybe had a friend doing it at the same time I was or a very pushy crowd behind me I would most likely be getting to the jumping faster. What stood out to me is the amount of time that people took before they decided that they wanted to jump off of the diving tower. I was most surprised when I saw the old woman jump off of the diving tower because she was so daring at such an old age. Even I would not have been courageous enough to jump off of the diving tower This week\u2019s film club showed me that you are never too old to have fun and enjoy life. I hope to be as healthy as the old woman in this video when I become elderly. This is a great way to take this video. I love that you took this in the way that you can never be too old to be have fun. I never would have thought of looking at this film in this way. I agree with what both people are saying. People are naturally going to be scared of their fears, but you have to have the courage to overcome them. I agree with your statement saying how courageous the elderly women are in the film, they should be the most afraid due to their fragile bodies, but they are the most courageous in the film. They really show that fears can be overcome if you block out the negatives and the consequences and look at the positives in the situation. A moment that stood out for me in this documentary is that the older women was very hesitant to jump and said she did not have the the guts to do it and started going doing the steps then comes back up to actually jump. Most of the men could not even do it because it seemed to impossible. This really surprised me because I would think that a man would be more fear less and more willing but in this film it showed that most of them people who when up there all had the same thought oof that the jump was to far up and very intimidating. When i watched this I wondered if I would go through with it and jump. I like the fact that you mentioned that most of the time men did not jump because they perceived it as impossible. The film club shows how gender stereotypes can be incorrect most of the time. In society, men are seen as brave and independent whereas women are seen as cowardly and dependent. Whereas in the video there were more women who jumped than men. Also, most of the women who jumped were alone and the few men that jumped were with someone. Another thing that the video challenged were stereotypes about old people. The elderly are seen as weak and fragile but in the video the woman looked like she was in her 70s and she jumped off of the diving tower. I agree with the fact that everyone thinks that men are more likely more brave than women but after watching this video it showed you that stereotypes are not always true sometimes it could be wrong because of the amount of women that through with it and jumped. It didn't cross my mind that the men were so cowardly towards the task compared to women. I admired the bravery of the women since most of them were alone when it came time to jump and they needed little encouragement to take the risk. I was quite impressed by the elderly woman who was so fearless and took the risk at her age which ultimately shut down the typical stereotype for the elderly. I have noticed that the people that were in a group of two was more likely to jump, as for people that were by themselves, more walked off. I would say peer pressure did play a role in the amount of people jumping, though personally I wouldn't jump. It looks like a good time in my eyes, but the people that re in the film don't seem to like it. I myself have jumped off buildings and bridges before and i think it would be a great time jumping off ten meter tower. I think that this video shows a lot of fear towards new things and texting peoples limits, but it encourages me to take the leap next time I am in a situation where I decide to jump or not. In my opinion i think this is crazy i would never be able to do it the people who did are very brave and the ones who did"", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

We would like Digest to supersede Basic. As long as there's uncertainty that Digest is widely supported by browsers, servers will of necessity ask for authentication by either. If servers can ask for both kinds of authentication, there's no incentive for browser vendors to support Digest. So (I believe) they won't. So here's a proposal: if an HTTP/1.1 agent (client or server) supports Basic, it must also support Digest. Authentication support remains optional, but it's all or none.

This was what it was originally proposed as. The original idea was that DIGEST would be the preferred method and that BASIC be *VERY* strongly depreciated. That is why so much effort was made into making a scheme that was 100% plug compatible with BASIC. If the idea was to produce the best possible digest authentication scheme we would have made a very different proposal. About the only use for BASIC at present is in conjunction with SSL where it might possibly be preferable to DIGEST but not by much. I like Dave Kristol's proposal that suport for BASIC in 1.1 implies support for DIGEST.

Name: John Boyer Email: JBoyer@PureEdge.com To: John Boyer; Gregor Karlinger Subject: RE: Exclusive C14N Error: Using #default in NMTOKENS said Hi Joseph, The prime motivation is that two XForms editors independently said they were curious why the DSig group did not use the more formal specification. Since it is possible to precisely say what we mean, I had no technical answer. But if the answer is consistency with XSLT's definition, then I would be fine with that. A secondary motivation is that, while I don't see a really good reason for being more precise, a fairly lengthy amount of implementation experience has shown me that the decision to be less precise often has a way of coming back to provide some really painful experiences. Still, in this case, the fact that we are somewhat constrained by people who have only DTD and not schema provides some reasonable justification for not going that extra mile. Consistency would be another reason (i.e. if such a level of precision does not match what was done everywhere else in the DSig related products, then it's probably not a good idea to introduce that in this one case).

Whitespace is officially part of the document's content, per the XML spec. The DOM preserves it. If you filter it out of the document before building the DOM, there's nothing we can do about it. Similarly, if your serializer introduces additional whitespace, there's nothing we can do about that.

Changing DNS is a serious thing that effects the fundamental architecture of the Internet. As such it is something to be done very carefully. Changing IP is even more scary and thus requires even more effort. App protocols, these days at least, have a shelf life measured in minutes. IDs are moving so quickly from first draft to deployed implementation that the application community is forced to come up with its own rules as to when something is done. Now a days a draft is considered fair game as soon as it passes working group last call. The rest of the process is considered irrelevant. This is not a workable long term solution as the draft can still be changed by the IESG even after surviving working group last call. Hence app types need a faster system which, once consensus has been reached in the working group, quickly ensures that the draft is frozen. There are no experimental app protocols and no IETF/IESG last call. If all the members of the working group buy off then you have something that will be implemented. That is the process the apps world needs. That isn't the IETF process. As I see it we have three choices: 1) Invent a new status above ID but below RFC that let's app developers know they have a frozen draft they can develop off of but one that hasn't met all the IETF quality bars. 2) Change the RFC process for APPs to lower the bar to working group consensus. 3) Form a new, separate, standards group specifically for application protocols.

We have anySimpleType?=anySimpleType anyType a subtype of item then you better have the > equivalence They don't make sense. How can item? be the same as item* (?) How can anyType be a subtype of item? anyType is an annotation attached to element nodes; no XPath value can ever be an instance of anyType (because the typed value of a node with this label is not defined); item cannot be used as an annotation on a node (because an annotation must be a schema-defined simple or complex type). The set of types available in XML Schema (simple types and complex types) and the set of types used for values in XPath are two overlapping sets. Their intersection is the set of atomic types. Complex types appear in XPath ONLY as annotations of nodes. Node kinds like element() and comment() appear as XPath types but not as XML Schema types. Item, being the union of node kinds and atomic types, is an XPath type but not an XML Schema type. So anyType and Item are in completely unrelated parts of the space.

Actually the document() function in the current working drafts allows the URI to contain a fragment identifier, and if it does, the returned value may be an element node rather than a document node. This is the way document() is defined in XSLT 1.0. We've made a recent decision, which (if all goes smoothly) will be reflected in the next working drafts, to use a simplified version of the document() function for XQuery. This will not allow fragment identifiers and will not allow multiple URIs; it will always return either a document node, or nothing. Michael Kay"", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

That would certainly be best for the DOM editors, but then wouldn't other WG's would have to deal with Gavin's API specification tags, that no one >other than the DOM WG has any need for? Would this noticeably inconvenience anyone? If an author doesn't need a tag, he doesn't have to use it. We've all been doing this stuff for over a decade--I don't see any inconvenience. The only overhead of extra tags is in DTD maintenance and possible tool support. Since the same tools will probably be used by all the working groups, the support effort is required--and will probably be easier if there is only one DTD. As far as DTD maintenance is concerned, one could argue both ways, but I would think having one DTD shared among a fairly small set of WGs--especially if managed by Eve--is still well within the limits of tractable and any overhead is outweighed by other benefits. The key benefit is being able to take any XML-related spec and read it using *the* DTD/stylesheet/whatever you've already set up without having to futz around all over the Web finding the right customization layer and twiddling stylesheets/scripts/whatever."", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

A removed node continues to exist until some memory management scheme destroys it, presumably after the application has released all references to it.

IMO, the HTTP spec already says this, but alot of non-normative material and common (mis?)understanding tends to hold 404 as being fairly representation-centric, which is where practical problems could arise. But my present usage with URIQA as a response to MGET indicating no description found is fully compatible with the present HTTP 1.1 spec, which simply says Not Found The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable. ] which seems to suggest a method-centric interpretation, and suitable to any arbitrary content retrieval method, not just GET and MGET."", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

XSLT users do occasionally grumble that they can't retain CDATA sections through a transformation.

If we have a million web sites of the nice kind being accessible, let us say WAI-A, we would still have a million very different web sites with very different information architecture, with very different navigation. Even accessible web sites are a big challenge for many people with disabilities. The major stumbling block is often the homepage of web sites, homepages are often very complex, and most often different from site to site. If the same web sites also use RSS Feeds, we have the potential of having one interface not to one web site but to a million web sites for all major items of news, articles, debates, product information, etc. Each group of people with disabilities could have their own RSS FEED Reader optimized for that particular group. The aggregated RSS Feeds would be a gigantic leap forward to a more accessible web, at least a much greater leap than some skip navigation for a single web site we use to talk about. We still have many problems with RSS syndication. At the moment some of the standards are made by half-crazy individuals probably knowing nothing about accessibility. Even W3C is not involved in some of the standards. RSS syndication is the closest we have been to the semantic web so far. A major battle is taking place.

I should have been more specific. RFC-3253 uses ANY as the DTD for all method request and response bodies, as we believed that was where extensibility was most required, and so we wanted to emphasize this fact in the protocol.

Why do it that way? It doesn't seem right to tie the encoding with the language specification. My understanding is that the encoding defines what numerical byte values are stored in a file to represent characters, while the language specification makes reference to how sequence of characters are made up to form words. I might very well want to write a French text in plain ASCII, using XHTML's ISO Latin 1 entities for accented letters. I might also want to write an English text, talking about accented letters, in ISO-8859-1 encoding/character set. I can understand if, for the moment, Amaya is limited to ISO-8859-1 encoding. But then, the insertion of the encoding=ISO-8859-1 attribute should be based on whether there is an accented letter in the current document or not. This is actually how my email program works.

That's not the same thing. No encoding means UTF-8 or UTF-16. Amaya should store documents as ISO 8859/1 unless told otherwise, as that is what most users will expect; i.e. it should default to storing in that encoding, not the XML default. XML then requires that the charset be included in the the PI and XHTML suggests/requires its inclusion in the http-equiv hack. What apparently is happening is that it is defaulting to UTF-8, although I suspect it only works correctly if the display also uses UTF-8. E.g. if I type GBP (currency symbols) the resulting document displays correctly in a simple text editor in CP 1252 (ISO 8859/1 superset), but the XML encoding says that it should be interpreted as UTF, which wouldn't correctly display. It's therefore either defaulting to 8859/1 or to the local GUI display encoding, not to the one it claims to be using.

Perhaps the advice section for 4.1 could include something to the effect that authors should follow the conventions appropriate to the natural language of the content. even in English, it's not always appropriate to avoid the passive. There are times when it isn't possible to assign grammatical agency-- especially in bureaucratic writing. The Section 508 standards would fail this criterion if we were to insist on it, for example. There are implicit cultural assumptions here, too. In the United States, for example, many people place high value on coming directly to the point, both in writing and in oral communication.

Name: Charles (Chuck) Oppermann Email: chuckop@MICROSOFT.com To: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org Subject: RE: Long descriptions in &lt;OBJECT&gt; said I disagree that PARAM is the best place. The whole idea of LONGDESC was because ALT, while allowing very long strings, does not allow markup. The inner text of <OBJECT> allows for markup. Also, how will the user agent know to read the PARAM? Most <OBJECT >'s have multiple PARAMs. Seems very clear to me that the designers of HTML knew that the best place for additional information about the <OBJECT>. The HTML 4.0 specification says: One significant consequence of the OBJECT element's design is that it offers a mechanism for specifying alternate object renderings; each embedded OBJECT declaration may specify alternate content types. I say that the markup is the best place for that information.

The philosiphy of the PARAM element is to be able to include attributes to OBJECT. However since new object types may require different attributes, by using PARAM rather than attributes to OBJECT one wouldn't need to change the HTML specs whenever a new object type is born. Althogh longdesc may be considered generic, and not object-type dependent the absence of longdesc as an attribute justifies using the PARAM mechanism. Being somewhat pedantic, concerning an example previously on this mailing list, PARAM elements must come before any other content of the OBJECT.

There is always a danger of course that users will discover that some implementations return results in a predictable and useful order, and become locked-in to this behavior. There are definitely arguments both ways on this one. One approach would be to define the order that distinct-values returns, and advise people to wrap it in a call of unordered() if they don't depend on this order.

But it brings up the following question: - is the long description only useful if the image is not accessible or does it complete/add to the image value ? I looked back at Gregg classification If the description adds to the image value, and is to be used with the image, there should be no reason for the author to hide its link, and the visible D graphics is my preferred method. It's not an accessibility issue anymore in fact, since the image is accessible. It's the metadata kind, where the image is the data and the longdesc is more data about the data (origin, context, etc) If the description is to be used as a replacement of the image (it completes ALT), then I still question the invisibility of the link in the case where several images are laid out together to form some kind of mosaic or other tight formatting wanted by the author: will the presence of any kind of valid markup that is not an attribute (like the proposed LONGDESC), like anchors (even null.gif border=0) modify the page layout in any way ?

I completelly agree with that. I made an implementation for DOM level 2 (without the events part, which actually is the real breakthrough of DOM 2) and i begin stress-testing it on a 1.7 MB file containing some 230.000 entries (I just copied and pasted the contents of the file, almost choking at some point XMLSpy Anyway, these entries eat about 50 MB of memory which i find pretty scaring, for a 1.7 MB file. I searhed my code for memory leaks or over-allocations, but found none. I tried to compute the size i was expecting from DOM to get, and got very surprised as i saw a HUGE number of TEXT nodes (about 55.000), barely containing TAB characters and /r characters. I know that the DOM MUST reflect the structure of the document, but these nodes are a pain in the lower layer and eat up huge amounts of memory. While it might sound stupid to IMPOSE the pretty-printing formatting on the developers of the DOM, at least some things could be done to reduce the amount of these formatting text fields in the DOM. The normalization method from NODE concatenates adjacent text nodes, but it's not the matter here.

The last phrase is absolutely essential. That four times is someone talking about a particular implementation, and is _not_ a reasonable rule of thumb. I'd say 1:1 was closer to average for DOMs coded by someone who knows what they're doing. The DOM API, per se, only specifies how the data is accessed; it says _nothing_ about how the data is stored, and implementations are free to trade off performance, code size, and storage size to suit their users' needs. depending on how it was written and the characteristics of the individual file. by maintaining only a single copy of each unique element or attribute name string. Since these are repeated many times in a typical mid-to-large-size document, that can add up to significant savings. There are other, less obvious, steps that can be taken to reduce storage, though some of them impose performance costs. Depending on what you're trying to do, that may or may not be a net win for your application's overall responsiveness. So if you don't like one DOM implementation's costs, then by all means try another! Also see http://www.w3.org/DOM/faq.html#SAXandDOM for a discussion of some of the tradeoffs. There _are_ some problems which are better approached via SAX, or via a custom model... or via a custom DOM implementation. Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Regarding the whitespace text nodes; That's something the DOM doesn't really have any choice about, since the XML Recommendation explicitly requires that all whitespace be passed through to the application. Many XML parsers have a filtering mode which allows applications to request that whitespace-in-element-content be discarded; check yours to see if it has that option. Note that the parser can only recognize this case if you are validating against a DTD or schema DOM Level 3's Load/Save chapter is considering permitting such a filter. I believe we discussed the possibility of also allowing user-written filters, so you could plug in logic to discard other unwanted information with or without a DTD's advice.

This is not a case of the XML processing rule in section 14, i.e. that the client MUST ignore unknown XML elements. This rule does not apply to properties returned by PROPFIND, since PROPFIND is defined to allow an arbitrary XML element in that position. Note that this is actually a bug in RFC 2518, since in section 14, it correctly states that the ignore rule does not apply to setting DAV properties (i.e. PROPPATCH) but neglects to mention that this rule also does not apply to fetching DAV properties (i.e. PROPFIND). But Yaron wasn't arguing that there is anything in the spec that says it is legal for PROPFIND to return extra properties, rather that: - it is not explicitly forbidden - it is semantically harmless to return extra properties (since a client can ignore the ones its not interested in) - a client should handle this case to be prepared for buggy servers. Although I agree with these points, I disagree with the conclusion, i.e. that a server should therefore feel free to send back extra properties. This just wastes bandwidth and processing resources, and wastes it in a way that cannot be controlled by the client. If a client wants the properties, it can ask for them. I believe whatever slight benefit one might imagine getting from these unrequested properties is significantly outweighed by the wasted bandwidth and client/server processing required to pass information that will, with a high degree of probability, be ignored by an interoperable client Name: Jason Crawford Email: nn683849@smallcue.com To: Clemm, Geoff<gclemm@Rational.Com> Subject: RE: PROPFIND returning *more* than expected, and other questions said Do we think we need to enhance the spec in any way? at least for the next 45 minutes.

Unless you are referring to HTML 3.2, 2.0, or 1.0, there is no real argument for HTML 4 over XHTML 1. I hope I am not mistaken in any way, but if I am, I would be glad to be enlightened. Wes Greetings all I would firstly like to congratulate the W3C and all related parties on their decision to move towards a more structurally correct design. The move is, no doubt, a very large decision and one which requires thought and planning. The transition to the new design appeared very smooth. I would like to address a trivial (at least, at this stage) issue that, nonetheless, deserves some attention. I would first like to start with a conceptual page structure: h1 (Banner) -links h3 (Headline) h3 (Headline) h2 (Navigation) h2 (Search) -search h2 (Contact) This type of layout would make sense to a browser which must make do with only the text flow of the page, as opposed to the positioned and correct rendering. Right now, to a browser that does not support CSS (or even a browser that supports CSS, but not properly) the ??? section appears first. Structurally speaking, this is not quite ideal. While the largest audience will be able to see the site properly, it would be better for the news to take precedence. This, unfortunately, is not possible with this layout and positioning combination. Setting percentages for each section???s width would ensure scaling would be possible. The floats would be guarded against being pushed ??? onto the next line?? when the window is very narrow in IE. Also, it would remove the feeling of unevenness, as the floats have caused an unsighly larger gap on the right side of the page (tested in Gecko and IE). I am certainly very excited about the new design. I will continue to read comments regarding the site, and I certainly hope to hear any comments regarding my message.

The spec is wonderful. Clearly written and laid out I was able to read it from top to bottom without once having to say to myself Having read the whole thing I have two comments: 3.1.5 Operations on a target resource do not affect references to it except as needed to enforce referential integrity. The last sentence of the last paragraph of section 3.1.5 states that For example, if the target of a strong reference is moved, the reference must change to reflect the new location of the target. When I create a strong reference am I referencing a particular resource or a particular location? If I am referencing a resource then having the strong reference change when the resource is moved makes sense. However if I am referencing a location then nothing but a DELETE should cause the strong reference to change. A MOVE, of course, is defined as a COPY followed by a DELETE, so it would seem that moving a resource on a strong location reference should result in the strong reference's deletion. I think it would be acceptable to specify that references only refer to resources not locations but I believe there really should be some clarification on the point. 3.1.15 Operations on a direct reference, except for creation and deletion of the reference itself, are passed through to its target resource. There are obvious problems with this rule for operations such as COPY and MOVE of the parent collection. I think language is needed to call out the fact that a direct reference is still a reference and thus certain methods, especially COPY and MOVE, may not be passed through but rather will effect the reference directly.

The problem about what we mean by direct references is a more difficult one. It certainly needs to be thought through more carefully than it has been so far. One approach that we could take is to stay with a very strict definition of direct reference: one for which no operations are passed through to the target. Then treat direct and indirect references as marking the ends of a continuum, where in between are references for which some operations are passed through. We could require that the protocol be able to represent direct references, indirect references, or anything in between (be able to say which operations will be passed through for any particular reference). Or we might be able to reach consensus on one or a small set of reference types that are really useful and must be supported by the protocol (not necessarily by servers). Indirect references are certainly useful.

In this case when we are interested in only a high level, arm waving sort of description what is it that a WSDL description brings that is required? I think this question definitely applies to WS-Choreography and possibly to BPEL as well (though generally that is aimed at a lower level) descriptions always needs to accompany a WS-Choreography description - they certainly will for a detailed level choreography description, but they seem to be too much detail (and will add many lines) when focussing on just the basic allowed message sequences.

Most of the BPEL spec applies both to executable and abstract processes. The differences for the case of abstract processes are detailed in sec. 15 and only relate to the way variables and assignments are defined.

But that is separate from using WSDL descriptions. In particular, those <invoke/>, <receive/>, and <reply/ > activities would still need a portType reference, even in cases where the variable reference attributes had been dropped. The answer to your Why question in the case of BPEL might be as simple as the one you find in Goals of the BPEL4WS Specification (see [1]), where it says: BPEL4WS is firmly set in the Web services world as the name implies. In particular, all external interactions occur through Web service interfaces described using WSDL. the process interacts with Web services through interfaces described using WSDL and (2) the process manifests itself as Web services described using WSDL. In any case, I am curious to see what types of answers your question on whether BPEL abstract processes need WSDL is going to get on the BPEL list.

The first alternative is top down where you define the high level flow of messages first and then work out what the web services you need since they don't exist yet and finally create the WSDL definitions for those services so that you can start building them. The second alternative is bottom up where you have some Web services that already exist and you need to define the flow of messages so that you can connect them. I think that both approaches are valid, however following the top down approach is hard to do if you can't define the high level flow until you've defined the web services to use as WSDL definitions. Bottom line, if you have to have the WSDL definitions before you can develop a chorography, a.k.a. message flow, you are prohibiting the top down method of development that I think many, but not all, business analysts would often want to follow.

In the XQuery/Xpath specifications we have chosen to also keep the original timezone as part of the value. Thus, if the lexical form for a dateTime is 2003-05-07T17:30:00-05:00 this would translate into a two-part value: a dateTime in the UTC timezone 2003-05-07T22:30:00 and the timezone -05:00.

To be definite, I would like to see the old-name functions being used for local accessors and a new set, e.g. get-utc-hours-from-dateTime(...), being used for UTC accessors. I realize that this creates some redundancy in the API, but as I try to rationalize the UTC semantics for accessors I can only imaging that they have fallen out from a desire to create a spec that is implementation neutral (doesn't deal with seconds since an epoch). This neutrality is indeed good, but while the UTC accessors create a kind of canonical consistency, they could be just an abstract concept used to communicate the spec with local accessors doing the heavy-lifting for users.

But we have deprecated the namespace axis in XPath 2.0 because we want implementations to have maximum freedom in how they represent the information that modelled formally in the Data Model using namespace nodes. In XQuery, and in XPath 2.0 if the namespace axis is not provided, there is no expression that returns a namespace node.

I didn't answer this question earlier because there is no clear anwer. The DOM spec is very vague in this area. While it does specify parent-child node type constraints (i.e. Comment node can't have child nodes), it does not come out and say whether a DOM implementation should enforce DTD constraints to the fullest. Even the HTML portion of spec stops short of spelling this out. The key differences between the core DOM and the HTML application of DOM is that the HTML Document Object Model exposes a number of convenience methods and properties that are consistent with the existing models and are more appropriate to script writers. In many cases, these enhancements are not applicable to a general DOM because they rely on the presence of a predefined DTD. For DOM Level 1, the transitional and frameset DTDs for HTML 4.0 are assumed. Interoperability between implementations is only guaranteed for elements and attributes that are specified in these DTDs. Above paragraph seems to imply that the assumed presence of a predefined DTD are there for the enhancements (convenience methods and properties) and not for enforcing semantic constraints. The problem is that sometimes you want the semantic constraints to be enforced but sometimes you don't. We can not just choose between predictability and flexibility because decision depends on the situation. Yes, I would like to assume that all table rows are inside table section elements. But then I would also like to be able to add some custom elements or attributes into my document. Perhaps what we need is a way to have two views of a Document.

Returning the empty sequence instead is delaying the moment > at which it is realized that there is an error. You are making assertions here which are not self-evident. There are different design options here, which have different pros and cons, and the optimum solution isn't obvious at all. One of the arguments is that when static typing is in force, a type signature of xs:double+ would not only require the dynamic type to be one-or-more numbers, it would also require the static type to be one-or-more. So users of static typing systems (for whom, I must say, I have little sympathy) would have to write min(one-or-more(book/@price)). Another argument is that allowing the ()->() behavior is consistent with many other functions and operators in both XPath 2.0 and XPath 1.0. The idea here is to emulate the behavior of SQL nulls. It allows you to write, for example book[min((@net-price, @gross-price)) This is consistent with many other operators and functions. In XPath 1.0, book[(@net-price + @discount) div 2 > 10.00] is not an error, and it's not obvious that book[avg((@net-price, @discount)) > 10.00] should be any different.

Many set-oriented languages define them. Some define them as propagating the absence of values (i.e. SQL propagates NULL, the empty rowset), some define them as returning the identity value of the underlying operation.

If we are using, say, fn:avg to calculate the average salary of employees in each department then if there is a department with no employees the it's better to return the empty sequence for this department rather than raise an error. You can wrap the function call in fn:exactly-one to make sure that fn: avg, for example, returns a single result. Empty sequences are pervasive in the datamodel.

For magnifiers: There is a serious conflict between the necessity of keeping everything on one page, and allowing users to control font size. for people with severe learning difficulties, this is particularly acute. magnifiers, allow one to gain a feel for the whole document, whilst enlarging a part. setting the font size to large makes the document larger than the screen, and one looses the ability to percieve the whole. further, a great number of people don't appreciate that there is more than one can see. from an offline discussion with Boris Zbarsky, following from a recent brief thread at www-style: scale: font-size to % of client window? thanks jonathan chetwynd Name: Slaydon, Eugenia Email: ESlaydon@beacontec.com To: w3c-wai-gl@w3.org Subject: RE: magnifiers vs relative font-sizes said I still have a problem with pushing for relative font-sizes in CSS because it is destroyed in Netscape.

Eugenia Name: Slaydon, Eugenia Email: ESlaydon@beacontec.com To: Slaydon, Eugenia Subject: RE: magnifiers vs relative font-sizes said But to say that a site absolutely will not meet standards if it doesn't use relative font-sizes is a big deal. As a developer I am told that I must make the site look right, work, meet standards AND do so in NN 4.x and above and IE 4.x and above. Netscape 4.x doesn't just not support relative font sizes So what is the lowly developer to do? I think one of the reasons that developers don't follow accessibility standards is because they can be so difficult to implement.

Name: Chris O'Kennon Email: chris@vipnet.org To: Slaydon, Eugenia Subject: RE: magnifiers vs relative font-sizes said On the one hand, I agree that many developers have trouble with the implementation of standards because browsers just don't seem to agree on what to do and how to do it. It's probably the only business where no one steals good ideas from each other. How difficult is it to just support style sheets the same way? On the other hand, many of these standards are tough because developers are used to just one way of doing things, and just one audience to do it for. I only recently even started using style sheets, because I just found it easier to hard code my font sizes into each page, so I'd know exactly what the layout would look like on every browser imaginable, and not have to worry about which ones handled style sheets. It may not be easy design to take so many variables into account when you create a site, but it's good design.

One might justifiably use keyDown/keyUp of the 'A' key in a game, for example, just as one might use the left arrow key -- as an on/off switch rather than as a means of text input.

ESC is ok. Why do you want to change it? As a Windows user, I find Esc very unnatural. It is a key I expect to use to close or cancel things. F2 seems much more logical. a <br> is normally inserted with shift return and not ctrl return. that's much more annoying in the Windows version. These are very common features in Windows applications (especially the keyboard shortcuts for selection) and Amaya would be more user-friendly (on Windows) if it used these conventions.

That is a strict requirement for compliance. YES, it requires that NodeList somehow be made aware of changes in the subtree it covers. YES, it means that the index number for a given node may change whenever the document changes. And YES, it is tough to implement this efficiently. In my experience so far, you have to settle for making common cases efficient and accept a performance hit on the less common cases... which requires that DOM authors decide which cases are common for the applications they expect to serve.  I generally try to steer users toward the DOM Level 2 Traversal mechanisms, or toward an explicit tree-walk if they're coding in DOM Level 1. Even though NodeIterator requires similar notification when the document changes, its recovery mechanism is a lot simpler and less expensive. TreeWalker's recovery is trivial since it just stays with its current node, and most user-written tree walks are equally simpleminded. If folks must use getElementsByTagName, I usually recommend they consider loop-until-null solutions rather than getting the length in advance. This may allow the DOM to perform some optimization. Other DOMs may behave differently, but I think these approaches are generally the way to bet unless you know otherwise. Of course if folks don't care about performance, and/or are sure they will not alter the DOM during the NodeList's lifetime, the answer may be Use Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Name: Joseph Kesselman Email: keshlam@us.ibm.com To: www-dom@w3.org Subject: Re: getElementsByTagName said If I have a readonly Document Node At this time, there is no way to make a Document node readonly using the standard DOM API. The only readonly nodes we currently support are those within the scope of an EntityReference. You could have a readonly Element node, of course. and I call getElementByTagName on it, should I return a readonly Nodelist? There's no such thing as a writable NodeList (NodeLists can only be changed by changing the source document), so the question isn't meaningful. Of course the nodes within the NodeList are the same Node objects that appear in the DOM tree, and hence may themselves be readonly.

Extensions to the UPDATE method allow multiple resources to be modified from a single UPDATE request (see Section 12.13). When a versioned collection is updated, this may affect the versioned collections and all it's internal members. One possible state transition is that a child is removed.

The client would then look at the DAV: version-controlled-binding-set of the DAV:checked-in version of the collection to see how it should update its local state One benefit of this approach is that it doesn't cause a flood of responses if you move a folder with 1000 members (i.e. it would return just the source and destination collections of the move, rather that 1000 added entries and 1000 deleted entries). Why do we need an errata entry? The question is whether removing a binding to a resource is considered a modification to the resource, or a modification to the collection containing the binding. For the purposes of UPDATE, I believe it should be considered a modification to the collection containing the binding only. The move (lower case) I was referring to was a multi-resource update that would result from a labeled update, or a baseline update. Such a multi-resource update could result in a logical move of a subtree from one URL to another. The other case would be with Depth and labels So the marshalling for UPDATE was defined with those two cases in mind (i.e. when multiple resources could be affected by an UPDATE). We could have defined UPDATE to return DAV:multistatus only if there were multiple resources affected by the UPDATE, but it was thought simpler to just always require the multistatus (probably not a big deal either way, OK, we could add some words about this in the Errata and the revised draft, if you think that would be good."", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

Moreover, the appropriate and customary braille treatment is not only a function of language but also of context. For instance, French braille in France is a little different from French braille in Quebec, rather different again from French as done by the British for English-speaking French students, and as you might guess the Americans do it still a fourth way. The result is that ambiguity is certainly possible, though I would have to doubt that that fact commonly leads to a lot of confusion because the human brain is wonderfully capable of sorting out, from the semantic context, which of several theoretical possibilities actually makes sense in the current instance. You don't actually have to mix several languages to encounter this phenomenon. For example, in regular contracted English braille, the slash or stroke (/) has the same braille representation as the letter-group st. The creates a theoretical ambiguity, and I have indeed heard stories where the ambiguity caused the reader trouble -- primarily when unfamiliar proper names, such as for products or companies, were involved. But in the overwhelming majority of instances, it's obvious that and/or makes sense and andstor doesn't. Present work in braille code design is in the direction of removing these kinds of ambiguities, mostly because they can cause problems in the context of technical notation. See the work by the Internation Council on English Braille towards a Unified Braille Code (UBC) for English at http://www.iceb.org and note in particular that the UBC project is still debating the point as to whether language switches should have an explicit signal in braille.

There is some probability of confusability for short sentences, but people can figure out what is going on. Also, I wouldn't expect much contracted braille to be encoded as HTML. Rather, when people talk about Braille presentation, my understanding is that they are dealing with uncontracted, otherwise printable, text in the language of interest, with an eye toward contracting and rendering it on the fly, or making hard copy from downloaded HTML/CSS files. In the WebBraille project here at NLS, we provide contracted braille material from a website, but it is not HTML. Rather, it is ready for embossing on braille devices at 25 lines per page, 38 to 40 characters per line.

Normally the screen reader would speak image then speak the Alt text. If an image has Alt text set to spaces then it would NOT speak image but simply pause before speaking the next block of text. In this way the transparent image would provide an aural pause that worked the same as the visual pause.

If a screen reader came across an image with null Alt text then they would have to assume that the image was not a 'spacer' and would have to say image.

For that reason, the best terms would be 'universal', or 'inclusive'. Good idea to poll these For that reason too, definitely no to the wheelchair symbol.

And the interactivity in the SVG and with the HTML (or ideally XHTML) is essential to many applications. SVG have resembled Flash. I think for tiny devices a scaled back spec makes sense, but compared to the size of typical browsers and operating systems of Today there is nothing bloated about Adobe's SVG Viewer on a PC.

Thanks for your observation about the fact that we aren't ignoring the existence of comments and PIs. Solving this isn't easy. If there are no element children, comparing the typed value makes sense. But mixed content is tricky. We could specify in prose that comments and PIs are (completely) ignored, but it's not so easy to specify in XPath code.

One applicable paragraph from RFC 2026: 10.2 Confidentiality Obligations No contribution that is subject to any requirement of confidentiality or any restriction on its dissemination may be considered in any part of the Internet Standards Process, and there must be no assumption of any confidentiality obligation with respect to any such contribution. As far as I know, RSA still claims that RC2 and RC4 are trade secrets. The TLS draft states that there is no published reference for the algorithms. I disagree that it's OK for a standards track document to include algorithms for which one has to purchase a sole source implementation, but it certainly seems OK to document how to use them with TLS, as long as it's done in a separate non-standards-track document. It would be ideal to have documentation of additional algorithms for use with TLS, both publicly available (Blowfish, SAFER SK-128, etc) and proprietary, patented, unpublished, or otherwise encumbered (IDEA, RC2, RC4, Fortezza, etc) and let market demand, performance, quality of protection, and cost decide what gets implemented in Netscape, MSIE, and SSLeay-based products.

The goal is to encourage interoperability by ensuring that anyone who wishes to use the baseline capability will have it available if they have a TLS-compliant product. Determining whether the baseline capability is enabled or not is a policy matter to be decided by the user/sysadmin/SSO, and the IETF is explicitly silent on policy.

Name: Reitzel, Charlie Email: CReitzel@arrakisplanet.com To: Reitzel, Charlie Subject: RE: Tidy becomes less forgiving said Hi Allen , You are not the first to raise this sensible point. However, Tidy strikes a sometimes uneasy balance between the HTML specs -plural- and what browsers actually do. If there is a general rule, it might be stated, 1) Parse any and all markup to the degree possible. 2) Emit spec compliant HTML that renders the same on most browsers as the non-compliant input. A bit messy, yes. Further, the spec does not directly address nesting <form> tags within various table tags (<table>, <tr>, <td>). According to the HTML 3.2 DTD, <form> tags are not allowed at all within a table. Only <tr>'s are allowed within <table >'s and only text elements are allowed within a <td <form > is a block level tag. HTML 4 requires an additional intervening TBODY tag. So we are already playing fast and loose w/ the spec. My only suggestion was to move the line over one notch - you've got to draw it somewhere. In hindsight, it appears that the W3C is losing the battle against layout tables, even if they are winning the style war.

I think the approach Allan and I have used in the past can be considered deprecated at best. I have migrated away from this approach because it has layout problems in IE. Instead of nested tables, however, I would suggest a single form and using a bit of Javascript to copy the data into hidden <input> tags before calling form.submit(). Name: Reitzel, Charlie Email: CReitzel@arrakisplanet.com To: Allan Clark Subject: RE: Tidy becomes less forgiving said I was asking for comments in earnest and have been convinced (see my previous posting) that <form> begin and end tags should not cross table cells - especially since you can force output. That said, I believe de facto standards carry every bit as much weight as unimplemented recommendations. I believe this is the spirit of both W3C and IETF standardization efforts. And, the fact is, all browsers do support the construction Allan is using. Are THEAD, TBODY, etc. portable across browsers? I just think it is really important to keep development grounded in what HTML coders use today. Name: Reitzel, Charlie Email: CReitzel@arrakisplanet.com To: HTML Tidy List Subject: RE: Tidy becomes less forgiving said Agree with most of your specifics. But consider those cases where most browsers support a feature not included in any HTML spec (e.g. cols attribute of <table>). Tidy knows all about this one and doesn't emit a peep. I.e. Tidy respects the de facto standard implemented by major browsers. Nor am I so quick to label as invalid large bodies of working code. Just as the ANSI standard for C didn't make all K&R C invalid. Surely ANSI C is better than K&R. But it took a while to migrate all the code over. Nor is the mere existence of a spec reason enough to migrate code. One must evaluate one or more implementations of a given feature before committing resources to such a task. If everybody took the rigid view, the web simply wouldn't exist. Then again, if we always carry forward the slop, the web would crumble under its own weight. In most cases, a thoughtful compromise is actually better than either extreme - even though it usually makes no one happy. De facto standards are, by definition, based on implementations - independent of specifications, if any. Specifications live and die by their implementations. The best specs *follow* implementation rather than the other way around. For example, dictionaries almost never introduce new words. They merely document existing usage, which 99% of the time springs up informally and is only occasionally dictated by standards bodies (varies by language). Have you seen an ISO stack in the wild lately? I respect and mostly agree with your point of view.

Perhaps no KeyInfo option should be required. 2) DSA support is required. Where the KeyValue element is used to identify a DSA key the presence of parameters is required (see section 6.4.1). The DSA parameter problem present in X.509 described by Santosh Chokhani (see http://www.cygnacom.com/downloads/dsaflaw.zip) is also a problem here. Parameters found in KeyValue cannot be trusted, should not be used and thus need not be included. The requirement that parameters must be included should be replaced with a requirement that parameters must be absent and be obtained from a trusted source. 3) Section 4.4 states that applications may define and use any (KeyInfo) mechanism they choose through inclusion of elements from a different namespace. This doesn't appear to be possible given the current DTD and schema definitions. Carl Wallace CygnaCom Solutions Name: Barb Fox Email: bfox@Exchange.Microsoft.com To: dsig Subject: RE: KeyInfo questions/comments said In response to your first issue: Do not assume that because an application includes a KeyValue as KeyInfo that the recipient does not have some a prior validation for that key. Unlike PKIX, we explicitly chose to leave trust managment mechanisms out of this standard, and we selected KeyValue as the MUST implement option to assure basic interoperability. I believe that presumption of a trust model (as in values passed must be trusted) is also the basis of your second issue. Barbara Fox Microsoft Are you saying that implementing KeyValue is a burden for developers? We chose KeyValue as mandatory to implement because it's the only semantically-neutral option. Every other choice indirects the public key, so this approach should guarantee the greatest range of interoperability. For DSA, think of the key as including these group parameters. To use a key for validation of a signature, the recipient would need to have all components of it (y, g, p, q) match the key he trusts. Name: Peter Hesse Email: pmhesse@cygnacom.com To: dsig Subject: RE: KeyInfo questions/comments said In that manner, why would it need to be implemented if it would never be accepted? ? Hesse CygnaCom Solutions, Pay no attention to what the critics say; there has never been a statue set up in honor of a critic. --Jean Sibelius Name: Brian LaMacchia Email: bal@microsoft.com To: dsig Subject: RE: KeyInfo questions/comments said Are you arguing that there is no value in sending information/hints about what key was used to compute the signature? To me, the contents of the KeyInfo clause, if it exists, are valuble precisely because they provide the entity attempting to verify the signature with hints to help him find the correct public key. KeyInfo clauses aren't intended as evidence carriers to the verifier's trust management system; presumably if that was happening in-band the information would be carried in other payloads with particular semantics. Acceptance of Keyinfo clause information for trust management purposes isn't the intent and should not be an issue. As a further question, when you and Carl speak of PKI-aware or PKI-enabled applications, are you specifically talking about X.509/PKIX-aware applications? The two are quite different in my mind, the latter being a small subset of the former. In particular, I expect to see entire public key infrastructures deployed based solely on signed XML messages.

If PKIX developers are using AKI-SKI chaining (which they would have to for any meaningful path discovery), then they would need to resolve to keys anyway. Unfortunately, MANDATORY can't be either - or. The underlying IETF concept here is to assure base interoperability, not offer a negotiation opportunity. So, I stand by our wg's decision for KeyValue as the only semantically neutal option. On DSA: I pulled down Santosh's paper and re-read it, and while it may have been accepted in the X.509 world, I see no reason that it applies here for the reason I stated before. Parameter substitution is always an issue which is why we decided that it takes all of the components (y, g, p, q) for a key to match a trusted verification key."", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

Trusted Digital Relationships Name: Dournaee, Blake Email: bdournaee@rsasecurity.com To: Dournaee, Blake Subject: RE: Canonicalization of &lt;SignedInfo&gt; for Reference Validation said I am inferring (from your example below) that well-defined transformation algorithms don't violate the what you see is what you sign rule simply because their behavior is open and known? How do we draw the line in the sand for transformation algorithms that preserve the wysiwys (What you see is what you sign) property. For example, it is easy to argue for pervasive transformation algorithms like Base64 Encoding or ZIP compression, but what about lesser known algorithms. What if someone decides to compress something with ARC? What about a proprietary compression or encoding scheme with a closed source? It's clear to me that an XSLT transform that deletes all element content in an XML Document would clearly violate wysiwys, but is there really a good way to measure this property? For example, in a courtroom if someone asks to see the document that was signed and a Base-64 encoded blob is shown to the signer, it will be difficult for that person to say: Yes this is the document that I signed, because in reality they saw something completely different when the signature operation happened. I'm guessing that all of this was hashed out some time ago Any thoughts or pointers to previous discussion on this would be most helpful.

In one of the examples that you used below, you mentioned Base64 as an encoding transform. This sort of encoding transform would have a great deal of utility in producing enveloping signatures over binary data, yet XML Dsig doesn't explicitly mention Base64 as an encoding transform (see http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#base64). The specifics for how decoding are to be handled are laid out, and Base64 is pervasive in other parts of the recommendation (for encoding key values, for example), but I can't see where Base64 is specified as a viable encoding Transform.

The alternative may be to simply require that the related choreographies should always be defined under a larger umbrella choreography, such that the dependency state management naturally falls within the scope of choreography.

Your idea of putting everything into one larger choreography becomes unweildy. For example the Order Placement choreography I gave is a medium complexity example of how to place an order. The simplest is where you just send an order and expect nothing in return. The other extreme is where the seller provides automatic periodic updates on the processing of the order. Our analysis at Commerce One has identified 14 different variations of how to place an order where each variation is a different choreography. Each variation can optionally include the use of a status inquiry. I also agree that we need to make a conscious decision whether this type of dependency is in, or out of, scope. David Name: Stephen White Email: swhite@SeeBeyond.com To: WS Choreography (E-mail) Subject: RE: More use cases said David, Is the handling of errors for every message something that should be in the choreography? If included, then it could prove to be an infinite cycle-e.g., there is an error in the error response message, which is handled as an error, and so on. This seems like another protocol that should be layered below the choreography. Name: Burdett, David Email: david.burdett@commerceone.com To: WS Choreography (E-mail) Subject: RE: More use cases said The answer is it depends. Errors associated with formatting of the overall message (e.g. HTTP, MIME or SOAP errors) should be handled at a lower level. At the other extreme some errors, e.g. product code not recognized can only be determined by the application/process/service that is processing the content of the message as, in this example, it requires validation against a database. There are also some validation errors of the content of mesages that fall in the grey area inbetween. These can sometimes be detected by an XML Parser by validating against the XML Schema and therefore could be considered as being handled at a lower level, for example an XML parser could check that a product code must be 10 characters alphanumeric and provide an invalid format error if it was not. Sometimes though the application has to do the check. One example would be checking the validity of a postal code as it is dependent on the country associated with the address. e,g, - a valid US Postal code must be numeric e.g. 94511 and in a UK code a Postal Code is alphanumeric with a space in the middle, e.g. KT11 2EN Since errors sometimes have to be handled by the application/process/service I think we have to consider them when designing our approachy to handling choreographies.

The positive size is the point size, where the system calculates ppem size (pixels per em - The ppem size is typically 96/72*point-size for the screen, because Windows uses a logical resolution of 96 pixels per Inch, while there are 72 points in an Inch.

It says in the decription for LOGFONT lfHeight with MM_TEXT map mode: This seems to equate to pt_size*96/72 with normal resolution of 96 ppi and is a more complicated way of saying what I am saying, because this implies that a negitive value is the ppem size of the point size after the calculation.

In the very early prototypes of Windows, there was no concept of point size or the Em. The typical measurement was thought to be cell height (font bounding box or tmHeight) so that clipping wouldn't be a problem. There was a concept of internal leading which was initially defined as the space where the accents go. As initial prototype applications were being developed for Windows, it was realized that the concept of point size or Em square was the recognized way of referring to type sizes. To adjust for this, we changed the definition of internal leading to be tmHeight - Em. In order for applications to access this new method, we overloaded lfHeight. A positive lfHeight will match the font based on tmHeight while a negative lfHeight will match the font on tmHeight - internal leading. erik@netscape.com [mailto:erik@netscape.com] I'm a typographer, not an engineer, and I've > absorbed only so much by hanging out with them.

The Web depends on a very high shared knowledge of the properties of URI schemes. New ones should only be introduced is absolutely necessary. Content-Types should be defined by URIs, as are XML Namespaces. These then leverage the existing URI schemes to anchor thier meanings in the web. This allows anyone to make a local private Content-Type or namespace for their own use. This does NOT apply to URI schemes.

Some server implementers may not want to copy version-controlled resources, eg the result of the copy would be a new non-version-controlled resource. I think this is why the specification is vague about the results of copying a VCR. Also note that in WebDAV (RFC2518 section 8.8.2) the copying of the resources live properties is optional (eg some servers may not copy the live properties).

See section 3.14 (Additional COPY Semantics) and section 3.15 For COPY I'd expect to got a new VCR at the destination with an exact copy of properties. See the DAV:must-not-copy-versioning-property postcondition defined in 3.14. Versioning properties are not copied by COPY. The resource created by the COPY is the same as would be created by a GET/PROPFIND(dead properties)/PUT/PROPPATCH combination (i.e. it is not version-controlled, unless the server automatically puts all resources under version control, and in the latter case, a new version history is created for the new resource). This implies that the new created VCR must share the version-history with the source VCR. No, this would never be the case. Is this desireable? Defining this behavior as not expected by the user, I'd say COPY means creation of a new version-history and copy of the checked-in version to that new VH. With that the checked-in property of the copied VCR must change. COPY of a VCR creates a new resource whose content and dead properties are the same as the source for the COPY. A new version history is created only if the server automatically puts every new resource (such as the result of a PUT) under version control. In this case, the checked-in property is guaranteed to be different. Same for MOVE except for the deletion of the source. No, MOVE is totally different. A MOVE is just a rename, so the resource (including all its versioning properties) remain the same, but it is now mapped to a new URL. From: Peter Raymond [mailto:Peter.Raymond@merant.com] For COPY I'd expect to got a new VCR at the destination with an >exact copy of properties. This implies that the new created VCR >must share the version-history with the source VCR. Is this desirable? Well, one can debate whether or not it is desirable, but it definitely is not correct. COPY does not create a new VCR, unless the server automatically puts all new resources under version control, and in that case, a new version history will be created for it. Both in section 1.3 (where the workspace term is defined) and in section 6 the DeltaV specification says that you can only have one VCR for a given version history in a workspace. If copy created a new VCR but pointed to the original VHR then this rule could be violated if the destination is in the same workspace as the source of the copy. If the copy does not break this rule then it would be fine to have two VCRs pointing to the same version history. Yes, but you need to use the VERSION-CONTROl request (identifying a version) to make this be the case, not a COPY. I certainly wouldn't have thought that moving a VCR would create a new history resource. That is correct. A MOVE is very different from a COPY, since it effectively just renames the resource, but otherwise leaves it unmodified. Name: gclemm@rational.com Email: gclemm@rational.com To: Ietf-Dav-Versioning (E-mail) Subject: RE: COPY, MOVE and VCR's said Just to make sure there is no confusion on this point, the behavior of COPY is independent of whether or not the destination is in a workspace. In either case, a new resource is created at the destination, which has no relationship to the source resource, other than having the same content and dead properties. The behavior of MOVE is also independent of whether or not the destination is a workspace, except that a MOVE from one workspace to another will fail if there already is a VCR for that version history in the target workspace. Note: This means that Daniels first assumption was incorrect, but instead the defined behavior is closer to the behavior that he wished was the case.

But 3.14 states (DAV:copy-creates-new-resource): If the source of a COPY is a version-controlled resource or version, and if there is no resource at the destination of the COPY, then the COPY creates a new non-version-controlled resource at the destination of the COPY. The new resource MAY automatically be put under version control, but the resulting version-controlled resource MUST be associated with a new version history created for that new version-controlled resource, and all postconditions for VERSION-CONTROL apply to the request. so there would be a new version-history for the copy-target.

And alleged RC4 is also posted on Ron Rivest's web page. But I'm sure Phil Karlton had a copy of Schneier when he wrote the statement There is no good reference to these [RC2, RC4] as they are unpublished works in the SSL specification. This statement is still included in the current TLS draft -01. Perhaps you should check with RSADSI to see if they still regard RC4 as an unpublished work, despite the fact that it leaked out some time ago. Why don't we add some Blowfish CipherSuites? It's a published (and public domain!) algorithim. And Blowfish was mentioned the last time this came up, several months ago. The point of removing RC2 and RC4 from the TLS base document is * not* to prevent their use with TLS, it is to restructure the IETF TLS standard as a core document plus additional ciphersuite-specific documents. This follows the IPSEC example of generic AH/ESP documents supplemented by additional transform-specific documents. I thought the working group had reached consensus on a modular document structure, and am a bit disappointed that the present draft does not reflect that consensus. The TLS base document should specify mandatory-to-implement algorithms to promote interoperability. Currently the DES/3DES ciphersuites fill that role, but Blowfish or another published and freely-available algorithm might conceivably be suitable as the interoperable baseline. TLS transform documents could be written to specify the use of many other ciphersuites, published or proprietary, including RC2, RC4, Blowfish, SAFER, Fortezza(R), etc. This makes it easier to add future ciphersuites to TLS without having to re-do the base document every time.

Links for site navigation? Links that are atable of contents for the page User Agents could create lists of links based on the REL attribute for direct > navigation. There are two different things to consider. One is defining a list of roles for document relationship like next in print order, toc, etc. The other is defining how to encode this relationship. We can work on the former in our WAI forum, although it could probably be handled somewhere as it is pretty pervasive (some of it is already in the HTML spec) For the second, the issue is that we have a W3C technology, RDF, that's coming along with a solution for metadata like that, and we also have attributes, such as rel, that already exists in HTML. One question is whether it's worth defining a bunch of roles without an agreed way to implement them (assuming we can't make our mind between RDF and simple/obsolete rel) and what will the UA do with either a too-modern solution or a too-old solution: maybe nothing. Since it's in the HTML spec, we could push on author and authoring tools for adding rel for LINK in the HTML head (like the W3C slidemaker tool does) and on UA for presenting them to user (like lynx does).

The DOM is for documents, and the document does begin at the HTML element. But the window object exists in all cases - there is always some User Agent presenting the document - and W3C text often refers to The Viewport and its Canvases. A Spec ought to be written to nail down exactly what these are. As it stands now many methods and properties belong in the window object, but without a Viewport OM the W3C is unable to specify them. Further, in the case of framesets (which are defined by the W3C), each Frame really ought to be an object that inherits from Viewport (resolving a lot of inconsistencies) rather than the long list of exceptions required today.

Joe Kesselman / IBM Research Unless stated otherwise, all opinions are solely those of the author. This does mean, however, that you cannot use firstChild and looping on >nextSibling to traverse the children of a node, I think. You can use it at risk if the tree is being edited. If the node you're asking for its nextSibling was moved elsewhere in the tree, or removed from the tree, or has more nodes added after it, its nextSibling will be taken relative to its new location. If all that's happening is appends, though, nextSibling will either point to the right thing or be null meaning you've reached the end of the document. but that's the application's responsibility. Of course similar caveats apply to NodeList. As insertions and deletions occur, trying to go from node i to node i+1 may find the expected next node, may skip nodes, or may skip back to an already-processed node. If all that's happening is appends, item(i+1) will either point to the right thing or be null meaning you've reached the end of the document. If you think appending is still be going on, you have to re-query item(i+1) but that's the application's responsibility. Much of a muchness. NodeList's only advantage over an iterator is that even users who can't understand next ought to be able to deal with +1. Whether that's a community worth catering to, rather than educating or addressing via a higher-level tool, is something we'll never agree on.

Lately I have been leaning to introducing new methods in order to simplify the standard text. Re-using existing methods for related functionality has proven to make specs harder to read. For example, in my GENA spec I specified that SUBSCRIBE can be used with a NT header to create a subscription and with a Subscription-ID header but no NT header to renew a subscription. The result is that I had to put in some fairly confusing language to explain what to do if a request has both a NT and a Subscription-ID header. After that experience I just introduce a RESUBSCRIBE method to simplify things.

This is the means by which several Windows-based screen readers current use to access HTML tables. Using scripts to unroll a table is one possible means to achieve what Scott wants, but it is not the position that I'm advocating. The advantage of this approach is that it'll provide a lowest common denominator approach, workable for legacy aids. The disadvantage is that in order to be useful, the script would have to intelligently restructure the table - possibly making incorrect assumptions. Another means, similar to a script, is directly modifying the object tree to eliminate the table structure. This method must be implemented by the user agent or the accessibility aid (as JAWS for Windows currently does). The advantage of this method is the same as the first method. The disadvantages are the same as the second method. Finally, the user agent itself can unroll the table, using an internal script or other code or by merely changing the rules by which is displays tables.

If we assume that removing a nonexistant attribute is an uncommon action -- which is probably true -- performance is probably not a major concern; you only pay a penalty if the exception must be thrown and caught.

Where did this list come from? It turns out that our server doesn't check for any headers in the footer, with a comment in the code indicating that the only footer defined for 1.1 is Content-MD5:, which we don't support. My recollection of why this was done this way was fuzzy, so I went back and checked the mail archives. Around the time of the LA IETF there was some desire to remove footers entirely from chunked T-E. Phill Hallam objected strongly to this, and a compromise was reached where Content-MD5 was allowed in the footer for 1.1 and future versions of HTTP might allow other headers. The issue was considered closed for draft 04 in http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/hypermail/1996q2/0058.html . The wording has changed a bit since then (I vaguely remember that happening as an editorial change) , but I believe the intent is still the same, which is that only Content-MD5 is valid in an HTTP 1.1 chunked footer. I agree that the text could use some clarification. I think the simplest change consistent with my understanding of the intent would be to add a sentence to 14.16 saying This header is allowed in the chunked Transfer-Encoding footer. Regardless, our server supporting this hasn't shipped yet, and I'm willing to change it if there's consensus that other headers should be allowed in the footer.

Examples have a strong normative influence on implementations, and since we are requiring support of Digest authentication, it should be used in some of the examples. Furthermore, by using Digest in some of our examples, it demonstrates that Digest authentication isn't just window dressing in the Security Considerations section. However, the point is well taken that other forms of authentication are very likely to develop over the lifetime of the WebDAV protocol, such as those based on biometric information (e.g., lost cost fingerprinting, eventually ~$10/device in volume, at: http://www.whovision.com/info_fr.html), or in an underlying protocol, and hence not all examples should use Digest authentication for their authentication. These sections should have a brief note which states, In this example, user agent authentication has previously occurred via a mechanism outside the scope of the HTTP protocol, in an underlying transport layer. However, I feel we should keep the Digest Authorization headers in the LOCK and UNLOCK examples of Sections 7.12.9, 7.12.10, 7.12.11, and 7.13.1 to drive home the point that these methods require authentication to have any meaning. I believe that the details of digest authentication are being > > tweaked (yes, even at the last minute) so that it's risky > > to include examples unless you're prepared to update them. Since WebDAV is using RFC 2069 as its reference for Digest authentication, and the Draft Standard version of Digest auth. is not yet complete (or even in working group last call), for the time being the Digest examples do not need to be synched with these changes.

If you could suggest what DOMTestSuite.js could sniff to determine that MSXML4 is the appropriate parser to test, we might consider adding more smarts.

TITLE is related to function. It's a shame that with <AREA> the guidelines have already converted the original meaning of ALT into a more functional role, this is exactly what IE4 does not recognize ALT on AREA, but does recognize TITLE. The problems arise with image only links. Where does TITLE go? I say as part of the <A> tag, since the *function* of the image is where it's directing you to (the link). TITLE=Enter my world Regardless of whether or not you think the above example is correct, the Guidelines (and the HTML specification) should clarify the correct usage of ALT and TITLE (and LONGDESC). Charles Oppermann Program Manager, Active Accessibility, Microsoft Corporation A computer on every desk and in every home, usable by everyone! I'd like to call out a specific portion of this issue: <<Using ALT functionally provides the necessary information for text-only browsers, while using it descriptively provides a cruel reminder to the text-only user that the Web doesn't like him. Of course one could argue that text-only browsers have the implementation backwards if you agree with Chuck's interpretation of ALT and TITLE. Clearly we need to decide which is which. To me, the words suggest the meaning I have described, but I recognize that others interpret this differently. So what about looking at the issue from the point of view of existing implementations? speech browsers do the same. Since text-only browsers and speech browsers are the most important targets of browser accessibility, perhaps we should yield to these existing implementations. ALT and TITLE are pigeon holes for information. The meaning of these placeholders should not be distorted because of the way current browsers present the information. With advances such as Active Accessibility, Dynamic HTML and the Document Object Model, it's much more important to make sure the *conduits* for information (attributes) exist and are not redundant and are very clearly defined. Just because a certain browser presents the ALT attribute in a certain way doesn't mean we should distort the meaning of ALT to fit. It's hard enough to get people to use ALT as is. If there is even the slightest doubt as to it's correct usage, it'll be hard to get implemented. ALT/TITLE/LONGDESC have to be clearly defined. Name: Charles (Chuck) Oppermann Email: chuckop@MICROSOFT.com To: HTML Guidelines Working Group Subject: RE: ALT text said I strongly disagree with this interpretation of ALT. Every book I have on HTML specifies that ALT is a description of the image. The HTML 4.0 specification says that TITLE is advisory information. Are we going to say Use TITLE as functional information EXCEPT when there is a image and then use it as a description of the image? So for a textual link it would go like this: <HTML A HREF= TITLE=enter my home page Click here but for a image link it would be: <HTML> A HREF= TITLE=enter my home page <IMG SRC=globle.gif TITLE=picture of the world That's making exceptions in the meaning of TITLE. In my view it should be: <HTML> A HREF= TITLE=enter my home page I look at the above examples and think it's clear why there is a separation between ALT and TITLE. For starters, in this case, the image *object* has no functional meaning. It's the anchor surrounding it which gives it functional meaning and as such the TITLE indicates that. Just like it would for non-image links. The whole reason TITLE was invented was to supplement existing attributes, not to replace them.

If you don't nail down DOMString to _something_, you don't have a binding. The solution we've used in the past is for the binding to state what specific type DOMString is mapped to. Another solution would be to say that DOMString will itself be a specific interface in this binding, derived from or wrapped around whatever the implementation wants to use. There's nothing inherently wrong with providing a DOM-like API that supports only 8-bit characters in a specific encoding, but if you do so, be sure to clearly document that divergence and don't claim to be a fully compliant DOM implementation.

If you're lucky, the cat will bite it deeply enough that you can depress the plunger then and they'll barely notice. Additionally, you'll have made the process a little more fun for your cat, so it will resist less next time. You can also speak to your vet about other options for the medication's form, if administering the liquid is just too difficult. Some can be prepared by compounding pharmacies to have a more palatable meat flavor (i.e. chicken), others may be available in a pill form that can be hidden in specially designed treats. If administering the current liquid is too difficult, it's worth exploring what other options are available to you.

He dislikes the taste, but we give him a small amount of food with the medicine in it first thing in the morning, when he is quite hungry. After he has eaten that, he gets the rest of his breakfast without any medicine. He has learned to eat it quickly. Answer ID: 24082 Score: 1 The success of this method may rely on you particular cat's age and temperament, but it may be worth trying my preferred method: train your cat to willingly drink from a syringe. I stumbled across this idea when I needed to medicate just one of two kittens, and the other one seemed curious about trying to drink from the syringe. Start by dipping an otherwise empty syringe in something smelly/delicious that your cat likes. I use the liquid from a tuna can (a lot of tuna isn't particularly good for cats, but it is safe to give in small amounts as a 'high value' treat), you could also use the juice from a can of with-gravy-style cat food if you and your cat prefer. Let your cat approach at his own pace, and if he sniffs or licks the syringe, give praise and an additional small treat. Then try getting him to let you put a drop of the treat-substance into his mouth. Work up to putting an amount of treat-substance close to a medicine-dose amount into his mouth. The next step is (if you cat doesn't currently need any liquid meds) for him to drink plain water from the syringe, followed by praise and a treat. If your cat does need meds when you get to this point, you should skip the water and go on to giving medicine at this point. When you are done the course of medication, it's a good idea to periodically reinforce the trained behavior with tuna water, or plain water and then a treat, so they remember what the syringe thing is all about. When my cat does need meds, I draw up the proper amount in the syringe, and then draw in a bit of the tuna water after, so it's the first thing they taste. You might find it helpful to designate a specific place and time to take medicine so it becomes a normal part of your cat's routine. Once it becomes a normal thing that happens on a predictable cadence, it will be less stressful for your cat, and you may even find him already standing in the designated area when medication time comes, much as he would at mealtime."", ""sub dataset"": ""stack""}",[],['']

Answer ID: 13762 Score: 13 Using information cleaned from this answer , I can tell you that yes it should have. His bones have become laced with beta adamantium (at least at the time that Wolverine: Origins is filmed). The only known occurrence of Adamantium Beta was during the Weapon X Project. By the second part of the procedure when they laced his bones with Adamantium there was a reaction with his healing factor that bonded metal and bone. As a result the Adamantium heals just as his bones do. Two things to note from this: His bones are laced not replaced, thus along with it being Adamantium Beta is possibly not as strong as True Adamantium, and it doesn't completely cover it completely. If even a small piece of shrapnel had penetrated and not just dented his skull and concussed him the Adamantium Beta itself should have healed over leaving no 'scar' so to say. Answer ID: 13502 Score: 11 I don't think there's an in-universe canonical answer to this outside of the quote you already mentioned. I think this is one of those times that Hollywood got it wrong. You're right in that it shouldn't have pierced his skull It should have bounced. If a real bullet can bounce of a normal human's skull (which does happen) then even an adamantium bullet would bounce off an adamantium-laced skull. I suppose an argument MIGHT be made that the shape of this particular bullet was designed to penetrate. it was tapered in an unusual way to increase the sharpness of the point, but still I doubt that would be sufficient. If adamantium can survive a nuclear blast intact, the paltry energy produced by a tiny amount of gunpowder would hardly be sufficient to overcome the strength of the adamantium. Again, it should have bounced, and bot the bullet and Wolverine's skull would show no damage. </s>Answer ID: 103330 Score: 6 Wolverine has fought villains that have Adamantium bonded to various parts of their bodies, for example: Lady Deathstrike, Donald Pierce, Sabre tooth, and most notably in this area of discussion, Cyber. Cyber's body was coated in Adamantium and Logan could not hurt him at all with his Adamantium claws. He had to find another way to take him out. His Adamantium couldn't pierce or scratch Cyber. Therefore, the bullet piercing Logan's skull should never have happened, but look at Deadpool in that movie; that shouldn't have happened either. Answer ID: 27432 Score: 1 The answer is bad writing. The bullet should have just bounced off. His adamantium is bonded in way that allows his bones normal bio-functions to still work, (Probably cause after he was written as a character someone said ummm that would impede marrow and blood production) But its still indestructible metal, so no it doesn't heal. I always assumed his healing factor took care of that with the bones being encased in the stuff. The amount of gunpowder in the casing would never have the force needed to penetrate it either. It was just a storyline brain fart so they wouldn't have to figure out how to film capturing, brainwashing him, and him escaping again. If they made a dart gun with a chemical made from Striker's son's brain to do the washing. Have them say they haven't perfected it yet, and it causes neural damage, chance of death etc. would have been way more believable. Answer ID: 176325 Score: 1 It shouldn't matter whether or not the bullet would penetrate. Adamantium doesn't have magical properties that kill off people with healing factors. In the second X-men movie we see Wolverine get shot in the face by a cop with a normal lead and copper FMJ round when they were fleeing Bobby's (Iceman's) house. Granted the bullet should not have penetrated the Adamantium , but it did pierce his skull and it entered his brain, dropping him to the floor. A few moments after we think he's dead, his healing factor pushes out the bullet and he returns to consciousness like nothing ever happened. An Adamantium bullet wouldn't do any different. And there is another factor that makes the Adamantium bullet impossible. The bullet would have to be able to conform to the grooves and lans in the barrel of a pistol or rifle. A smooth bore shot gun would have worked for the Adamantium bullet concept, but not that revolver they had in the movie. Being Adamantium and being indestructible, the bullet would have gotten lodged in, and distended, the barrel and the gun would have blown up in Lauren's hand. Beyond that, the gun just happened to be in the appropriate caliber....not likely. The Adamantium bullet is a very weak point in an otherwise outstanding film. Neither the FMJ or the Adamantium bullet should be able to penetrate Even if the Adamantium bullet penetrated, wolverine, or at least X24, would have been able to heal through it Bullet would never have shot out of that revolver, both for reasons mentioned and not mentioned."", ""sub dataset"": ""stack""}",[],['']

Answer ID: 5682 Score: 20 If the reason you are having trouble reading the small type is because you are farsighted/nearsighted, or because it is dark (causing your pupils to dilate and your vision to get fuzzier) you may find it useful to use a pinhole lens. Make a pinhole in a piece of paper or some other thin object, using a pin, safety pin, or the tip of a knife, and then hold it close to your eye and look through it. The image as viewed through the pinhole will not be magnified, but it will be in focus. The smaller and more regular the pinhole is, the sharper the focus will be (and the darker the image will be, due to less light getting through). I put a pinhole in one of my credit cards, and sometimes use it to view restaurant menus which I would be unable to read otherwise without glasses due to my farsightedness and the dim light that typically happens in restaurants.

Don't dismiss this as not helpful though -- it gives more than one way to improvise a magnifying 'apparatus' I'll try and describe with words, but the visual example is linked below. Take a look, sound isn't necessary if you want to mute the video. About 3:30 long Break into the bottom of it (the part that spins into the socket) with a screw driver or some such. Be careful to keep the glass intact. After getting the filament out, use a pinch or 2 of salt to clean out the white powder. Swish/swirl it around inside and it'll clean the powder off. Rinse, then refill and you have yourself a curved lens for magnifying. Get a small bowl/candy dish, the inside should be about the size of your fist. About 2 feet by 2 feet of clear plastic wrap, center the wrap over the bowl, then line the inside of the bowl. Fill the bowl with water about 3/4 full. Then bring the corners of the plastic wrap together, gently lift the water out of the bowl. The water will make the plastic sag, so carefully twist the top of the plastic so it ends up like a small baggy. Keep twisting until the baggy becomes tight like a ball. You have yourself a curved lens for magnifying. Less practical, but it'd work. Take a picture frame without the glass or backing or anything, just the frame. Place it on top of two stands, as if the frame was about to become the top of a table and the stands were the legs of that table. Grab that handy plastic wrap and spread it across the frame nice and smooth. Tape the plastic securely to the frame. This would be the clear, plastic wrap, table top. Slowly pour water onto the plastic and it will sag, creating a lens. Put whatever you want to magnify under the table and look through the water to see it magnified. Using a water bottle, with water in it. Near the bottom of the bottle or the top of the bottle, you should be able to angle it just right to get a magnified image. The video uses water and a chemical reaction to create heat, which doesn't address the question at all. My own thoughts: A whiskey glass with just the right amount of water in it. Whiskey because the bottom is already in a concave shape, so the water just increases the effect (I'd imagine) A cell phone camera with zoom and a steady hand.

Remember to remove chuck keys or any other tools used to tighten any parts before turning on (hang them or use a magnetic holder near the on-off switch so you can't forget). Check clearance of stock from the tool rest by rotating the workpiece by hand before turning the motor on. Start at low speed. Turn off lathe if making adjustments. your turning tools are sharp before using. Try to have two hands on the turning tools at all times (not always possible but good general practice). Remove tool rest before sanding. If doing groove burning never hold wire, cord or string in the fingers. Always wrap around scrap wood handles.

Securing your turning piece well is very important, I have had a couple pieces fly off the lathe, after the first one bounced off my chest (it hurt) I learned to stand off-center to the rotation of bowls. If your lathe has a safety cage, I would recommend using it (generally on larger lathes because you can have larger pieces mounted).

Answer ID: 8838 Score: 19 Buttermilk is already thoroughly packed with live bacteria. During its manufacture, that bacteria already consumed some portion of the available lactose and turned it into lactic acid. Because of the lack of food, acidity, and the extreme competition it is pretty hard for buttermilk to go bad. The good bacteria will stay active and the buttermilk will get thicker and more sour until it runs out of lactose. In fact- when your buttermilk container has about 1/2 cup left you can make more just by refilling the container with milk and leaving it to ferment on the counter for a day. If you use it up more quickly than the bacteria eat the lactose then you can keep this up indefinitely. Don't worry if it is thicker- if it still smells good then it probably is.

From personal experience opened milk keeps in my refrigerator for 7-10 days beyond the sell by date. Smell your milk before drinking or using it. Obviously if it's chunky it's also well past bad.

You should probably take a look at the Wiki page for Vito Corleone , as it does a good job summarizing his entry into organized crime. In short, Vito is somewhat thrust into the role originally due to the actions of Don Fanucci. Vito must rid the neighborhood of Fanucci, and in doing so he becomes well-respected in his neighborhood. This leads to additional income from offering protection, which is much more than he could make by just being an oil importer.

I think when he jumped from a small burglar gang with his friends, to organized crime was when he didn't like how Fanucci exerced his power and took him out. You can see in this video how Fanucci was too heavy in extortion and was responsible of Vito being fired. This might have induced personal resentment from Vito. When he was in charge of the neighbourhood, he was more protective to the other people, hence more respected. Why did he murder Don Fanucci? I suppose when you ask Why cold blooded murderer? This question explains it well. As Don Fanucci was not liked by the people, as he was putting too much pressure on them, and Vito supposed he was not as powerful as he seemed, he took his chance to take him out. He had probably in mind that he would be more careful to his neighbours. Legitimate business? It is the opposite.

After killing Fanucci the entire neighborhood changed towards Vito and began treating him as an important person. Even Clemenza and Tessio changed towards him showing both fear and respect.

He don't protect his own people, he don't help them. And he fear that one day Fanucci could go after him and after his family.

In the book, he kills Fanucci because Fanucci is demanding 700 dollars worth of what Vito helped steal (which, because of Don F. he was forced into) and he reasons, if Don F. needed an operation that cost 700 to save his life, he would not pay for it. So it is worth it to him to kill Fanucci, a plainly terrible man. He then assumes Fanucci's place in the neighborhood but due to far greater talent and respect, he goes much further. He probably never planned on being a criminal per se but in a world where violence was used frequently, casually, he had no choice.

It turns out that even an hour or two on the counter makes little difference to the temperature in the center of the steak. The limiting factor for browning is the evaporating all of the surface water so that the temperature can rise above 212 F / 100 C. Due to the significant energy required for evaporation, the energy required to warm the steak from refrigerator temperature becomes insignificant. On the other hand, when and how you salt does make a difference in the quality. The best options are to salt at least 40 minutes before cooking, or right at the time of cooking. The reason is that if you salt 40 minutes ahead, the salt dissolves, and then the juices are reabsorbed. With less time, there is not time for reabsorption, so you would be better off waiting until the time of the cooking. Kenji's conclusion is: Don't bother letting your steaks rest at room temperature. Rather, dry them very thoroughly on paper towels before searing.

On the other hand, other experts say the plants are more likely to die from copper poisoning before we do! Since your raised bed is only 8 inches high, you have the alternative of not using the timber, and just use rounded edges. Eventually it will hold itself in place as the soil web rebuilds, and without the timber there, you don't give a place for snails/slugs to hide during the day. You also increase the surface area for planting. As you've seen, there are many opinions on how to create a raised bed. Since the earth has been tilled, I'm presuming it's now loose, but you could loosen it further using a spading fork to a depth of 16 inches so that your total depth of uncompacted soil is going to be 2 feet. If you have straw readily available, one of the easiest things you can do is to create a no-dig garden . In your case you can just layer down manure and compost, and lucerne straw, and then water it in.

The rest of the circuit serves to get a constant current through the laser diode: the OpAmp will vary its output to get the same voltage on its two inputs, hence the voltage across the resistor R4 will equal the voltage set by the potentiometer. If the voltage across R4 is fixed so is the current, which is the same as the current through the laser (minus the much smaller base current for Q1).

Take it out, add some herbs or flavourings if you like (bay leaves, lemon, thyme, spices etc) pour in half a bottle of wine and about the same in water. Cover the shoulder in a sheet of baking paper, then cover tightly with foil (occasionally foil will stick to the fat on the pork, so it's best to have a layer of parchment between). After it's slow cooked at the low temp and is falling apart tender, take it out and turn up the oven again. Strain off all the juices for making your sauce, then carefully remove the skin and lay it on a seperate, dry, tray and give it a blast in the hot oven . This has always worked for me as you're getting perfect meat and perfect crackling. Slow cooking meat always makes the skin flabby and if it's a joint as large as a shoulder I'd prefer to remove the skin and blast it at the end on it's own rather than still on the joint as you run the risk of drying some of the meat in the process of drying the skin enough for it to crackle.

With this kind of decks your win condition is to make the opponents burn through their whole deck, bouncing their minions back in hand and eventually killing them through fatigue damage. In these decks Nat the Darkfisher is very good since it gets a good body (better than its 2-mana cost) with an effect that, while being problematic in other decks, helps you progress your win condition. </s>Answer ID: 264088 Score: 4 Going along with walrus helmet's comment and Mathias711's answer, one possible use of Nat is as a counterplay against the heavy control/combo decks such as wallet warrior, freeze/giants mage, and fatigue druid. These decks revolve around controlling the board, outlasting the opponent and letting fatigue damage kill, instead of actually dealing damage to face with minions. In these decks, every single card counts, so any milled cards will most likely hurt the opponent's game plan significantly. Thus, Nat would be used to surprise the opponent into drawing 2 cards and milling when the opponent is on 9 cards in hand. However, he is significantly difficult to keep alive and effective, as he is such a small minion and the opponent can either play around Nat, keeping 8 cards in hand, or just remove him with the good removal tools that those decks run. Thus, Nat will probably not last over too many turns and will need to have an immediate effect to be useful. Therefore, he is fairly well used in a mill deck, where he represents the opportunity of an additional milled card, but even so, he is not very effective, as the mill opportunity is 50-50. Alternatively, and perhaps more effectively, he can also be used as a win condition in the fatigue game in a fatigue deck, since he can be used to force the opponent to draw fatigue cards and take the resulting damages. The opponent will be highly compelled to use removal on him instead of your other threats, since he represents a far larger source of damage than normal minions. A deck idea that uses Nat is a Reno fatigue warrior, since Reno control decks usually run into fatigue and run a large variety of cards to keep Reno active at all times. Nat would fit well into this archetype because he can be used to force the opponent to draw at any time, especially in the fatigue game, during which most of the opponent's removal will have been used up.

Answer ID: 38445 Score: 8 You can make your own retention system for any bag which will hold the helmet secure and close to the bag. I've done this on a number of my bags as I carry both bicycle and climbing helmets at times and there is never enough space for them inside a bag as they're such awkward shapes. Buy some elasticated cord (often called shock cord) and some cord locks of an appropriate size for the diameter of the shock cord you have. Threading this through a strap or some webbing on the bag and leaving the cord locks outermost will give you a size adjustable retaining loop that will hug the helmet to the bag. Alternatively, find something (I've used shaped pieces of wood or plastic) that will fit lengthways through a vent on your helmet, but is too long to fit through the vent when rotated sideways. This becomes your toggle, tie this to the shock cord and you can use a single length (easier and neater to tuck away when not in use) with the toggle at the end. To fasten the helmet, push the toggle through a vent and twist it sideways so it can't fall back through the vent.

My backpack has a dedicated helmet holding piece, but I don't use it, as inserting or removing the helmet requires adjusting 6 adjustment straps. Instead, for longer climbs, when wearing a helmet would only be filling my eyes with sweat, I clip the chin strap under both of the top cover straps. This keeps the helmet mostly in place. On the other hand, on a short climb, or when in the city I want to enter a shop, I clip the shoulder strap to the plastic ring on the shoulder strap. That way I can put the helmet on and off without stopping riding. On a side note, I use those rings also for protective glasses and cable lock. For me, both of those methods result in gradual stretch at the buckle of the chin strap, so the helmet needs to be re-adjusted now and then.

This is why it is a strong component of pain relieving cream or ointment. In effect what it does is create a shield that blocks the nerve from experiencing sensation without the presence of capsaicin. This effect is experienced on tastebuds as well, effectively making a person unable to taste food unless it is spicy. Perhaps this is the reason for his quote in season one. If the observers are always eating overly spicy food as is suggested by their non-linear time state, then their tastebuds would be completely blocked by capsaicin.

Since the security screening equipment and plastic luggage bins aren't even remotely close to sterile, you might want to bring a clear plastic bag to put the machine in to avoid contamination. Sanitize it again at your earliest opportunity. Medical devices like a CPAP are generally treated different than regular carry-on luggage.

If in-cabin storage is limited and passengers are having to gate-check their carry-on bags, medical devices typically get priority (even if they have to bump somebody's bag that's already on the plane). The problem with CPAP devices is that they frequently have carrying cases that do too good of a good job of blending in with normal luggage.

Nowadays, in the UK, Christmas is a minor blip, not a sales extravaganza as people wanting kids bikes go to non-specialist shops and get something cheap. Much like how Christmas comes earlier and earlier every year, so it is with 'next year model' bikes. As a consequence you can have two model years in the showroom. Sometimes the model range is tweaked (e.g. Ridgeback) or all new (e.g. Giant). Tweaked model ranges tend not to precipitate a sale price on the old models, all new model ranges can result in sale prices for the old ones. Given the above, February is probably the best month, i.e. when the local bike shop is most wanting any money in the cash register for cashflow reasons. The question is, do you really want the bike that nobody else wanted, the one that has already seen a few test rides and been knocked about a bit? It can be a case of buyer beware but definitely worth looking out for. However, given that the new bike will hopefully be your pride and joy, consider getting a new bike, in your size, on special order so that it is truly brand new.

I have noticed that in Southern Ontario (Canada), the new models for mid-range and above bikes (say $800 CAD) can be discounted by September, if not sooner. Large bike manufacturers tend to announce their models for the next year by early fall, so retailers may be anxious to clear out old stock at that point. By year end, there will also be more consensus (sadly this information tends to be conflicting) on which models have quality or build problems (more frequent than you may expect). Speak to several riders you trust for feedback, but beware of of the 'zealous' who often try to impose their opinions ;-) Other times to look for deals are during local bike shows. Retailers are often present with stock they want to sell off, and you may find a good deal. In this case, since you may only have a few hours at the show to make your purchase, it's very important to do all of your research in advance . Find out: Which retailers are attending, and what can you find out about them? What products will they be selling? Do you have a personal relationship with the retailer/purchased from them in the past? You may be able to negotiate a better price based on repeat business.

The line that you were interested in Uptown funk you up is mostly a pun, a play on words, where the word funk has replaced a similar word (change the 'n' to a 'c') in a commonly used expression that means essentially the same thing as mess you up. </s>Answer ID: 692 Score: 9 The literal meaning of uptown is usually the more northward part of the center city, but it has connotations (via New York City) of an urban area that is more upscale, wealthy, classy and sophisticated. Funk is a style of music pioneered by black American artists such as James Brown and George Clinton, it was most popular in the 1970's and features a strong percussive effect from a variety of instruments, together creating a strong driving beat. Typically funk is a messy, dissonant sound played at loud volumes with a strong visceral impact. It is often used as a dance music. The word itself is potentially related to the other meaning of funk as a strong, somewhat unpleasant organic odor (typically body odor). As a united phrase, Uptown Funk promises a sophisticated, urbane variation on a raw and powerful musical genre. The specific lyric funk you up is a stock phrase in the genre, probably originating with Clinton's influential band Parliament Funkadelic , which used variations on it in several of their songs (including one that includes the phrase funked up in the title). It's a play on the phrase f* you up, primarily meaning to beat someone up, and has the connotation that the music is going to physically attack you, with secondary connotations of sexual satisfaction. The song as a whole is a tribute to a 1970's era image of macho sophistication. The lyrical structure recalls funk hits such as Brown's Sex Machine and Clinton's We Want the Funk, with a series of call-and-response style boasts, toasts and exhortations, deployed towards the goal of increasing audience engagement and working audience members into a funk-inspired frenzy.

This is important to know, since that would influence my choice of tools. A magnet will stick to steel. If so, then a magnet will not stick to some grades of stainless. This looks like a steel doorframe channel. For example, on steel, I'd go with an angle grinder as the fastest way to make the cuts, and a way to make a fairly straight cut. But aluminum would gum up the cutoff wheel. For aluminum, I'd choose an oscillating multitool, like that from Porter Cable, Dremel, Fein, Bosch, etc. These tools take a toothed blade that oscillates rapidly, and will cut through aluminum easily. Again, you will get a fairly straight cut with the proper choice of cutting blade. Lacking either of these tools, or being unwilling to buy one, I'd go with a hacksaw, which can cut either metal. Of course, a hacksaw will yield a somewhat jagged cut unless you have some practice here. One problem with the cut will be in minimizing any vibrations of the metal as it is being cut. A jigsaw, or oscillating multitool, or hacksaw will all cause the material to bounce around. A good vise will help solve this. In fact, my preference would be to clamp a piece of sacrificial wood inside the channel, then put it all in a vise. That will yield the best and most vibration free (therefore cleanest) cut possible. In any event, I'd expect to need to clean up the edges, rounding them so there are no sharp edges. A file will do for a start, then I'd switch to some emory paper.

The cheapo way would be to use a hacksaw for the lengthwise cuts and then a series of drilled holes along the crosscut, then use cutting pliers to cut the leftover metal between the holes and a file to remove the major burrs. You can use the drill-cut-file technique for the lengthwise cuts too. If you follow this way leave some extra space between where you drill and where the cut needs to be - some metal will be wrecked into chaos and you'll need to file it away.

Blade Selection is Important For both tools, selecting a blade with the right tooth profile and pitch for the material is important.

Is the popular method of cooking a chicken perched on an open beer can really a good idea? Some studies have linked BPA to cancer and other harmful health effects. To evaluate the ramifications of cooking chicken on a beer can, we roasted two whole birds, one set on an open beer can containing 6 ounces of beer and the other on a stainless-steel vertical roaster with the same amount of beer poured into the reservoir. After roasting the chickens, we collected their drippings and stripped each carcass, grinding the meat and skin to create homogeneous samples. We sent the samples to a lab to be evaluated for BPA content. In each chicken, the BPA measured less than 20 micrograms per kilogram, leading us to believe that the beer can cooking method is safe. (The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s current standard for exposure is 50 micrograms per kilogram of body weight for adults, or 3,400 micrograms per day for a 150-pound person.)

Sell the rest of them in bulk. Generally speaking, commons and uncommons only go for about $.01, unless they're especially valuable in one of the non-Standard formats. As for where to sell them, you have basically three options. Sell them to your local game store. This is probably the most convenient option, but be aware that the local store is likely to offer you less than you could get in other venues, and they're usually flooded with commons and may not agree to buy your old commons and uncommons at all. Sell them yourself on eBay. This is what I did when I needed to get rid of a few thousand old commons, which I sold in a great big unsorted box. You'll probably get a higher average price per card this way, but you'll have to handle the hassle of shipping yourself. And be aware that big boxes of cards can be heavy , and therefore expensive to ship. Sell them to an online game store that buys cards. This is probably the least attractive option, since they will usually only offer prices similar to those you get selling to a local store, but you still have to ship them. </s>Answer ID: 5462 Score: 5 Definitely take the rares out and sell those separately.

If you don't mind spending a bit more time on the issue, use your knowledge of the game to sort the commons and uncommons into which seem to be better than average and which are just typical. Look up the prices for those that seem good or are otherwise unusual online and perhaps sell those separately. As to where I'd definitely check your local game store first as you'll get to deal directly with someone who has plenty of experience with card prices. If the owner won't buy them, ask if you can post a small notice somewhere in the store that you are selling them and give a brief description of what you have.

Magic Card Market for europeans is a good peer to peer selling platform remember though, its not just rares that can be worth money , there are commons and uncommons that are worth more than many rares. wasteland , an uncommon, is worth around $60. Karakas , another uncommon is worth around $100, and mana drain , a third uncommon, is worth $172, there are also various commons, such as Serum Visions which is worth $3, or something like sinkhole , a $30 common. It is very much worth, if you are looking to get the best price for your cards, going through and finding the cards that are worth money, a quick way to do this is to print out a website's buy list and use it as a cheat sheet for cards that are worth money, if its on the list, you may well want to sell it individually, and you should set it aside (for now) and check its actual retail value (often three or more times what the buylist price is). if its lower than you want to bother with (its well worth setting yourself a limit, e.g. anything worth less than $1) sell it as bulk. once you have set aside the cards you want to sell yourself, pick your favourite avenue, the returns you get depend on the time you want to invest.

Most are likely 2000 or more years old. In many ancient Asian legends there are stories of animals that, after meeting some condition, are able to transform into humans for periods of time. The most common, is the fox. The  Huli Jing  or  Kitsune  (Chinese or Japanese respectively) is sometimes described as a demon fox, or fox spirit, or a fox that has lived 100 years. Make no mistake, this is no god that takes the form of a fox or anything, this is literally a fox that gains a spirit, or becomes one, after living 100 years. These foxes can transform into humans for a time, and often take the form of beautiful women, hoping to seduce a man and (in some cases) take his heart or liver. Some stories say that after eating 100 hearts/livers the fox can become a human permanently. The fox myth is all over the place stretching through many nations. This fits best with the notion of cyclic transformation, as the fox is technically unable to stay human and is cursed/gifted with human form. The restrictions on this are usually never clearly stated, as the stories written from the perspective of the fox are typically ones that show the fox as benevolent and having fallen in love with some person, but cursed to be a fox. Often they can't stay human simply because it uses too much energy. A second example is the White Snake . The specific story of Madame White Snake (published in 1620, but existed in oral form for centuries) states that a thousand year old white snake fell in love with a man and transformed herself into a woman to win him. Her goal was not to become human, but instead a goddess through doing good deeds. This isn't a cyclic transformation though. A third example is that of the Bakeneko . A cat that has lived for 100 years, or simply grew too heavy, may become a Bakeneko. This cat can transform into a cat-monster by night where it: takes the form of a human, can re-animate corpses, throw fireballs, and, of course, kill/eat people.

Central London has good coverage from all providers the rest of London is adequately covered again if your staying long term make sure you accommodation isn't in a blind spot on the providers coverage map. Outside of London and the main centers coverage varies form network to network so choose accordingly. The network providers are O2 , Vodafone , Orange(t-mobile) and Three and.

Most importantly, an official visit, even relatively informal and with a light security detail would always be preceded by contacts at multiple levels to set the program and agenda, organize the practical details, agree on the protocol, etc. Heads of state do not show up or even officially request anything before they already know that there is interest on both sides.

It kind of postulates that there was once a time in our history where supernatural beings were a part of our reality, the Gods intervened from time to time, etc. This period ended and we developed modern technology and science, but we so abused that knowledge in many ways that we threatened the continued existence of life on earth, so those old powers stepped back in and caused the Change. There is more to it than that of course, there are powers from outside of our universe that are seeking to enslave mankind and must be battled to prevent their success. Of course the form those external powers take in our reality depends a lot on your point of view, so the Christian Monk in the story has a vision of Mary Magdalene, the Wiccans encounter their God and Goddess, those of Norse heritage meet Odin etc. The reference to aliens comes from an explanation for the Change made by one of the characters where he says we have no idea what caused it and its completely fruitless to try to figure it out given the circumstances, he then makes a casual reference to Alien Space-Bats, but this is not the real cause of the Change just a spurious statement to say it was caused by something beyond our ken.

First, note that the equation given in your question defines an ideal (non-physical) capacitor and so this is the context of my answer. Second, note that if the capacitor voltage is discontinuous at some instant(s) of time, the time derivative of the voltage does not exist there . However, one can approximate a discontinuity by, e.g., letting the voltage change linearly with time over some short interval. For example, let the capacitor voltage change linearly from \\$0\\mathrm V\\$ to Then, according to the ideal capacitor equation, the capacitor current during the transition is $$i(t) = In the limit as \\$\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0\\$, the capacitor voltage becomes discontinuous (finite change in zero time) and the capacitor current goes to an infinity large, infinitesimally short pulse; a current impulse .

In order to change the voltage on the capacitor, you would need to add or remove charge from it... which is physically a current. Infinite current might be imagined as charge popping into existence on the capacitor -- but any real current would manifest as charge carriers traveling to the capacitor. The charge carriers will begin to affect the voltage on the capacitor as they approach, and this will cause a non-instantaneous change in voltage, no matter how fast (below infinite speed) the charge carriers are traveling. Paraphrasing Feynman, 'Nature is the thing that we are studying. The math just describes the way nature already works.' Answer ID: 209712 Score: 3 A lot of good answers, but they don't really answer the question. The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly. According to .. a discontinuous change in voltage requires an infinite current, which is physically impossible. The voltage rate-of-change (i.e. Volts per second) is directly proportional to the current;$$ \\dot{v} = i, $$so if the current jumps, then the rate-of-change jumps. How does this relationship prove that a discontinuous change in voltage requires an infinite current? Mathematically, this is actually a deep and very involved subject involving the Newton\u2013 Leibniz axiom following the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Essentially it tells us that as long as \\$v'(t)\\$ is Riemann integrable, then$$ \\int_a^t v'(\\tau)\\,d\\tau$$is continuous. we see that the voltage must be continuous if the current is Riemann integrable. Physical (real) signals are certainly Riemann integrable, from which we conclude that \\$v(t)\\$ must be continuous. Note: If \\$i(t)\\$ is assumed to be piece-wise continuous, then there's an even stronger conclusion; that \\$v(t)\\$ is absolutely continuous . Answer ID: 209341 Score: 2 You'll only get an infinite current if you have a perfect voltage source and the wires have zero inductance. two other things which are also physcally impossible. The relationship Q=CV (charge in the capacitor equals capacitance times voltage), leads to the reasoning that a step change in voltage would cause a step change in charge, thus an infinite current. Real world devices only approximate the ideal described by that relation, typically also having internal resistance and inductance which reduces the current to something finite. Still, an approximately infinite current can do real damage in carelessly designed circuits.

Answer ID: 13005 Score: 6 I disagree with all this talk of wasting a lot of energy. When I am riding with constant pedal force, the suspension compresses very little, if any. The severe loss of efficiency occurs when power peaks to the pedals occur - sprinting or hill climbing. IMO the effect is very roughly up to 30% when sprinting. With climbing it depends on the terrain and your willingness to adjust gears. Keep a stable, high cadence* (as if riding on a road) and there will be no unnecessary compression at all. Now, locking the fork is useful for road biking, right? If you ride at a constant, high, boring cadence on the flat, boring road - no unnecessary compression. In my country, even in the capital, most roads have mean distance between road holes in the order of tens of meters. So I do not lock my fork.

However, I believe there is a big improvement in performance when standing on a climb with the suspension locked out. Some riders never lock the shock out, others, only occasionally.

Apply pressure to the coin so that it lifts up the end of the key ring enough to slide the key on. Then slide the key on. Remove the coin and slide the key on the rest of the way.

A way out of this is to somehow create some free time, to have a space to grow, to improve your spiritual practice. An answer lies in reducing your activities. When you have few duties, you have time to practice, because the answer lies in the Dhamma. For this you need mindfulness and the stillness. With the stillness, you\u2019re in a position to let go of nervous activity, to let go of unskilful things in the mind. With mindfulness and letting\u2010 go of the unwanted, you get to see things clearly. In Dhamma\u2014kayagatasati\u2014is mindfulness immersed in the body.

In the back of our minds there\u2019s always the fear of pain, fear of suffering. To be at peace we have to get past that fear. If you\u2019re afraid to face up to pain, the mind can never be in control over itself because it\u2019s afraid. Then even your own mind is not a friend. We\u2019re afraid of many things. There are fears associated with greed, with anger, with delusion. That is where you have to focus to understand your fears. You have to understand the emotions behind them. Then you will get to know which part of fear is dependent on greed / passion, / on the aversion, and on delusion. Then, when you address the underlying emotions, the fear will subside.

Tie it in both ends at the same time, having the broken ends sticking out together and as short as you can and still get the knot to tighten properly. Now the tricky bit, feed the shoelace in so that the knot does not restrict the tightening of the lace. If the break is somewhere in the middle of the lace you can just use it as usual, at the lower end of the shoe, lacing up with each half of the lace alternate, (as most people seem to lace up their shoes.) But if the knot is near the top of the shoe, but not all the way out, you may need to use an alternate lacing way which has knot out of the way. Bring the long end of the lace out of one of the bottom loops, the knot at the inside, and the keep the short end of the lace out of the way below the lacing while you use the long end to connect all there is to be connected, till both ends are the same size. Then use both ends alternatively for the top of the shoe. In some cases the knot is in such a position that you have to keep it nearer the top of the shoe when starting out. If you want to learn about lacing up shoes before you set out, I can recommend Ian's shoelace site. If you do carry a spare lace or a useful bit of string you can use it instead.

That particular example may be influenced by the fact that people also write the '70s to indicate the missing century component, and no-one ever wants to put two apostrophes in that single word.

The reason has been elegantly explained by Steven Pinker in his book, The Language Instinct (ISBN 0060976519). In one part of our brain, we store all the irregular plurals we know. When that fails, we apply a general rule we have stored elsewhere: for a plural noun, add -s . This is why many people tend to use mouses rather than mice for the computer pointing device. To these people, it seems like a new word, so they automatically apply the general rule instead of recalling the irregular plural for the name of the furry creature. Furthermore, when a person conceptualizes a compound word as a proper name for a thing, such as iPad 2 , that person will add -s to the end of it and get iPad 2's , just as we would say Bill Clintons , never Bills Clinton . Thus, because of the way our brains work, the plural form of any new proper name, even a compound name, will almost always follow the simple rule add -s to the end . Let me also address the point made elsewhere about trademarks. Trademarks which function as brand names are adjectives: Ivory soap , IBM PC . But a brand name can enter the language as a noun when people begin speaking of the thing itself using the trade name. For example, kleenex for a facial tissue was originally the trademark Kleenex tissue . When this occurs, the trademark office actually does the reasonable thing and withdraws trademark protection for the term. It does this by the logic that you cannot have exclusive use of an ordinary word. Companies are well aware of this. This is why their public relations offices will plead with the public to use their trademark as an adjective. They hope to influence the public to do so, because otherwise they will lose their trademark.

In general, I guess I'm asking how the heck these high end sound libraries recorded them in the first place? THANKS! Answer ID: 12060 Score: 3 I take it you mean low rumbles and such, and not explosions? Well, the secret to really kick-ass bass-effects must always begin with exceptionally good monitoring. See, bass is pretty much imho the hardest thing in the entire realm of sound to get great, especially the lower you go below 100Hz. For consumers, that mostly goes pretty unnoticed because pretty much everything they ever listen to, that actually has that kind of bass, is already heavily contained and shaped. For us making said effects though it is not, and for those buying already shaped effects they still must balance it, which can be very difficult if the mix-room isn't well padded in the lows. And add to that that the human hearing reacts very differently to bass that higher frequencies, only a few decibels might very well be the difference between inaudible and unbearable in the sub-bass (sub-bass is freqs below approx 70Hz, the subwoofer is an LFE). With a good and honest sub-woofer made for studio-work and nice acoustics this is literally a blast! How to reach these sound differ a lot between designers, though I'd say most of us work first and foremost with pitchshifting and bass-management like the Waves Air and such. Ta mention a few of the soundsources I often use to make dedicated bass-effects can be mentioned djembe-drums, dharbukas, large sheets of both a special plastic and different kinds of metal, a big auto-harp, and my own body. As it's often a pure matter of mic-positioning, you may find lotta really impressive sounds if you only play around with the mic in different ways for different sound sources. A common misconception is that to make something fatter you need to add more bass, but the truth is that that often just makes things muddy. Though it might sound like a contradiction, one often gets the best bassy sounds by adding more of the higher frequensies, the human ear is extremely sensitive to details and good details in higher ranges makes the sound much more prominent. Often though the best sounds are the ones created. Your best friend here is the pitchshifter.

While the sine waves by themselves are fairly stale, the acoustics of the room add harmonics and spatial quality which helps to make the low stuff organic.

See this FTB Wiki page for a comprehensive description of how they work, at least in version 1.0.3c. If you have reliable access to enough Ender Core blocks, then always grow Ender-Lily crops on that. Otherwise, if you have access to End Stone, definitely grow on that. Only half of the growth stages can advance to the next stage at any given point in time, and they're staggered so you won't be able to grow a crop twice in a row (except if you happens to try at the boundary between sliding windows, which is always at a sunrise when growing on anything but Ender Core). Using a Watering Can on the crop for a few seconds should be enough to force growth if it's possible. Otherwise, the randomness of block updates could possibly cause you to miss growth during a time when it's possible for the crop to grow. In other words, this crop forces you to wait a minimum amount of in-game time after planting before you can harvest it. For a crop planted on End Stone in the Overworld on a world that's hitting 20 ticks every second, the absolute best-case scenario outside of using Ender Core (which is very expensive) is that you plant it just before sunrise (50% of the time) and use the Watering Can, then it grows immediately, then sunrise happens and you use the Watering Can again and it grows again, leaving only 5 more growth stages to go through; sleep immediately when possible and use the Watering Can right after sunrise; do this until you can harvest it.

Akin to that one, adding chromatic notes from the b7, 7, R adds some funk as well as the #9 chord, which the guitar plays in just about every James Brown song ever. Just like the A blues scale has three notes in a row - D, Eb, E, add a note between G and A, so you get - A B C D Good ol' pentatonic sure rears its head in a lot of funk - A C D E G The #9 means you use both C natural AND C# if you are playing a chord (again in A), on bass playing off that half-step gives some interesting sounds.

If you use the blues scale, you won't be going too far wrong. The defining feature of funk is its rhythms.

C is of course the (minor) seventh of Dminor. This use of barred minor chords punctuated by the chord that happens to be formed by the open bar, strums of muted strings, and several other modifications of the basic minor chord are an essential feature of funk. The bass will be playing the roots of the chords (generally minor) with frequent use of the sevenths of those chords as passing notes, plus complicated scale runs and (if you want to bluff it) the disco rhythms formed by playing two different root notes an octave apart. Take those rhythmic elements away and listen to a saxophone, keyboard or guitar solo on its own, and you will be hard pressed to identify the music as funk (as distinct from blues, jazz or rock.) So you will be using normal diatonic and pentatonic scales, particularly the minor-sounding ones (dorian, the aeolian/minor scale itself, phrygian) and of course the blues scale.

Only by a couple microseconds, just to make the groove groovier. Usually drummers and bass players do this to make you feel sort of a longing. It's playing with time to evoke a particular feeling. Musicians play with time in other ways too like rubato (moving the tempo in swooshes between slightly fast and slightly slow). It's -kind- of a rhythmic version of suspended chords. It isn't quite right, but it feels good due to the anticipation or longing. Answer ID: 15388 Score: 8 My music teacher used to tell us to imagine you are sitting on top of a ball. This is right on the beat. Every note is right on the stroke of the beat. To play ahead of the beat, you play a bit early and it should feel like you are leaning forward on the ball. If you lean too far, you fall off the beat. To play behind the beat, play a bit late and it should feel like you are leaning backwards on that ball. Again, if you lean too far, you fall off.

It gives music that groove. Answer ID: 15407 Score: 7 Playing behind the beat brings 2 things to mind for me. It can either mean being a hair of space behind the beat, or it can be a physical note value like a 16th note, a triplet etc. Playing behind the beat, as others have said, gives the music a sense of forward motion. This happens because in your head you're expecting a note on the beat and you always get it just a little bit late which adds tension to the music. The 2 examples I always come to for this stuff are in latin music like santana: Note how the guitar is often held for a fraction of a second after the beat, giving a more emotive, tender feel. but it's not a set note length. and Stevie Wonder Notice how the guitar is putting emphasis on the small interval after the main beat (do) da da. This gives a solid sense of pulling you forward, and has a set interval which is emphasised after the beat. Exercises For practicing Santana style I'd suggest trying to play along with a backing track you're familiar with and just trying to get that similar sense of missing the beat as in the santana track. As for a set interval, If you have a program on your computer for music, write a simple melodic run starting on the 1st beat of the bar, then shift it forwards by a 16th note/semiquaver. Practice it over a metronome or backing track until you have a sense of the timing. From here, start playing with fun stuff like playing behind the beat and then resolving on the beat. You can get a really great sense of tension/resolution this way, and it's fairly easy to pull out in an improv situation.

How can it speed up ambiences creation compared to a regular Cubase/Pro Tools only workflow? Thank you guys, and enjoy the read. Answer ID: 5486 Score: 5 I believe that there is a misconception about Kontakt. It is an extremely powerful sampler but that doesn't mean that it is for musical content. Its just that most people have been producing kontakt patches that are musical because people are looking for it. Take a look at the video for this pack by NI and you can see how they create new ambiences. Its not the quickest way compared to just synthesizing it but you get extremely good results. I like the part about using the train sounds and layering it. http://native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kore/paranormal-spectrums/ Kontakt can do this very well because it has an extremely powerful set of sound shaping tools. Honestly, the tools are way more than you would need to make musical instruments. You don't need to get into scripting if you are not building extremely complex instruments with live control. Scripting is really used if you want to package the instrument properly but since you are building ambiences, I don't think you will need the power of scripting. You could use it if you want to building the instrument nicely for constant sound generation. The usefulness of using Kontakt to build ambiences is the flexibility to pile various sounds on each other and change the way they interact. You could use ambience samples and sounds like the train leaving the station and manipulate into a nice ambience track. Then top it up with one of the many synths available in Kontakt to have a nice low moving drone. You could even layer another patch in with voices. Then you can \u2018play\u2019 the instrument with a midi controller and change parameters on the fly. You can edit the midi to clean up the performance as well.

I find Kontakt much better suited for when I need real instruments. Your mileage may vary, and Kontakt is certainly capable of all sorts of weirdness.

Answer ID: 5483 Score: 2 For pure sound design, it's entirely up to you really. Kontakt is a pretty big piece of software once you get into scripting and all that, Camel Audio's Alchemy software is great for processing sounds if that more what you want to do, and so is Native Insturments Absynth . If you are willing to spend lots of time learning what is essentially a modular programming environment then Reaktor is well worth the effort (and things like puredata , Max/MSP or CSound might let you take that stuff even further if you wanted to). An alternative with Reaktor is to purely use stuff other people have built but put new sounds into them, or use them as the basis for your own creations. If you only want to play with stuff other people have made then I believe there is a free version of Reaktor that only opens patches other people have made and doesn't let you edit them.

This saved a tremendous amount of time in the long run over what would have been the tedious task of individually cutting hundreds of weaponfire bursts/tails, single shots, artillery, mortar-bys, and so on. Performing the elements via Kontakt (and using a lot of variations to keep anything from getting stale) resulted in natural-sounding background layers created very quickly.

Is it because Intel's state of the art fabs or is it the architecture of the x86? It hard to understand how a complex chip like the i7 can clock so high. Answer ID: 59944 Score: 6 The main reason why ARM processors are not clocked at 4GHz is power consumption. Architecture, fabrication, etc do play a big role, but the reality is that a tablet or mobile phone needs to last as much as it can off a battery, so all those factors are designed so that power consumption will be minimized. When going for lower power consumption, you sacrifice performance because of design choices in the node, architecture etc. Where C is a capacitance, V is the voltage, and f is the frequency. So it varies linearly with frequency, and it's why frequency scaling is so prevalent, even in laptops. Answer ID: 59975 Score: 5 I don't think there is any one cause, but a combination of several different factors. Power consumption in certainly one big reason, but not the only one. Intel does aggressively pursue the latest process, and that buys it some extra performance. It's difficult to say exactly how much, but a typical claim for a new process would be about 50% increase in speed over the previous one. Another difference is that Intel perform full custom layout to take full advantage of their own process. Arm supply their cores in different forms under different license terms, but typically as generic IP to be incorporated by other companies with their own IP in mainstream ASIC processes. As such, it is more likely to be treated as a black box by ASIC layout tools and not as tightly optimised as a full custom design. Hopefully someone with ASIC experience will correct this estimate : but from my FPGA experiments, careful hand placement can get about 30-50% higher performance than the tools by themselves. Put these two factors together and it is possible that Intel's implementation of the exact same design would be about twice the speed of a generic ASIC implementation. ARM can mitigate this by working closely with TSMC or other ASIC manufacturers to optimise their core for specific ASIC processes; I can't say how many of the ARM cores available are optimised this way. Answer ID: 59953 Score: 1 A significant factor is horses for courses. The i7 is marvellous in a straight line drag race but can't corner at all. Demand, power consumption, necessary cost and need are all factors. If you really really really wanted a 4 GHz ARM somebody would sell you one relatively soon - if you wanted to pay enough. The Freescale MCIMX535DVV2C ARM Cortex A8 is specified at 1.2 GHz datasheet here and the MCIMX6Q4AVT10AC ARM Cortex A9 quad core at 1 GHz datasheet here .

Adding those as external add ons to the i7 would be annoying [tm], at least. At $42.50 in tube quantities for the A9 and half that for the A8 it probably makes the i7 look like a really bad deal for any application that the ARM is appropriate to.

Answer ID: 60014 Score: 1 An issue not really touched on by other answers is the fact that while simple processors can do every operation using a relatively small fixed sequence of steps which run at a fixed rate, such a design requires that there be enough time between steps to accommodate the worst-case propagation delays. Subdividing operations into smaller steps will reduce the worst-case propagation for each step, allowing more steps to be performed per second, but the total time for each operation would be increased. If an operation doesn't require as input the result of a previous operation, it may be possible for the second operation to get started well before the first one completes, but for really efficient operation requires going beyond that. If operation #2 depends upon the result of #1, but operation #3 doesn't depend upon either of the first two, optimal performance should start operation #1, schedule #2, and start #3; once operation #1 completes, operation #2 can be performed. Essentially, what happens is that while subdividing instructions into smaller pieces (necessary for achieving higher clock rates) isn't hard, doing so without adding a lot of scheduling logic would decrease the amount of useful work per cycle so much that the amount of work per second would be diminished. The more scheduling logic one adds, the more one can shrink the worst-case propagation time without reducing the amount of useful work done per second."", ""sub dataset"": ""stack""}",[],['']

In my experience, what tends to happen is the established players have no problem with helping them to fight monsters they can't beat, meaning they'll level up and get loot just fine without needing a level boost. In terms of changing the play order, I have a feeling there's a card which influences turn order in one of the early expansion sets, something along the lines of Player is now fighting this monster, and play continues as though this were the player's turn, effectively skipping everyone in between - although I can't find the card name or text with a cursory search. Also, I wouldn't have said Munchkin is a game which particularly relied on the turn order, so I don't really see how this could be a problem. In my opinion, if someone gets upset over a new player joining mid-campaign in casual play, they're probably taking Munchkin too seriously. </s>Answer ID: 45639 Score: 18 If it's just for fun and everyone is still having fun, then sure. If someone finds their fun level jeopardized by, for example, the disruption of the play order, then either you should delay the introduction of the new player or change the mind(s) of the opposed player(s). Answer ID: 45640 Score: 9 Does it make sense: That depends on how long the game has been running. If you've only been around the table 1-3 times the disadvantage isn't so massive that the player has no real chance of catching up, more than that it doesn't make much sense to join games already in progress. Is it okay There's no major difference from adding a player, some things would have been different if the game had started out with 4 people instead of 3, but those are made up for by the disadvantage the new player faces by coming in late. The turn order is disrupted, but the new player gets none of the benefits or detriments of having been in turn order until now. The best place to add a new player to the game is immediately after the current player, so they get into the game and start their catch-up immediately. Answer ID: 45643 Score: 9 Would it be okay to join a game in progress? If everyone at the table is okay with it, of course. I have played dozens of games where someone or multiple people have joined late, I would restrict new players only if the end-game was clearly in sight. If someone believes mixing up the player order is a game breaker, they leave too much up to chance rather than strategy. It is just as likely they will be positively or neutrally affected by the new player order as negatively. New player will ally with a particular player. I've had people invite their friends part way through and this I was apprehensive, assuming they would just assist their friend to victory. Often they are even more competitive with their friend and if they are a good player will be persuaded by good arguments for coordination rather than blatantly helping their friend. End-game is in sight and new player has no chance. I have joined very late and still won games. But if the end is only a few turns away, the new player will only be able to throw their weight for or against one of the contenders. This leaves a sour taste in the loser's mind, even if they may have ultimately lost anyhow. New player needs to be taught the game. I am fine teaching new players at the start of the game, having a new player come partway through upsets the flow and may detract from other's fun. Best to wait until next game. Answer ID: 45641 Score: 6 Inserting a new player into the turn order is far less consequential than the change in balance of power that a new player introduces. Most games of Munchkin I've played come to a series of showdowns in which one player tries to win and the other players try to stop that player. Players too far behind have a much higher risk of kingmaking to end the game rather than trying to win. Given that, the question is whether a new player added at that point in the game has a reasonable chance of winning. You may want to have them start at a level higher than one (such as the lowest level any other player is), and possibly draw a few random pieces of equipment if the game is reasonably far along."", ""sub dataset"": ""stack""}",[],['']

For example, my road bike is fitted with a mountain saddle (a Serfas Tegu ) and it keeps me quite comfortable for rides of around 4-hours. Using a hybrid saddle on a road bike is perfectly suitable, however you may require a narrower saddle to accomodate the more aggressive riding position (see Should I use a narrower saddle on my roadbike than I would on my hybrid commuter? ); however your LBS has likely taken this into consideration already. If you are still experiencing discomfort, then you may need to try a different size or a different model. Saddles are highly personalized options on the bike, so it may take a couple returns before you find the correct one. The position of the saddle on the bike is another aspect of comfort. Some riders prefer their saddles at a slight angle, while others prefer it to be level. Keep in mind with any new saddle there is a break-in period. Typically you should put several hours of riding time in before making a conclusion--unless it is very uncomfortable right away. Also, are you wearing padded shorts? Padded shorts add a huge amount of comfort--moreso than more heavily padded saddles. Typically you are better off with a good pair of padded shorts and a fairly firm saddle than you would be with regular clothes and a very cushioned saddle. If you have any concerns go back to your LBS and try to find out who their saddle guru is.

Question tags: <vegetables><pizza><spinach> Accepted answer ID: None Score: 10 When making pizza, do you put the spinach on raw or cooked? I would prefer to put it on raw, but I am concerned that the high water content in the spinach will release in the oven and make the crust wet. I have used well drained cooked spinach in the past but I find no matter how hard you ring it out, it is still very wet for a topping! I am using baby spinach. Any suggestions? Answer ID: 36747 Score: 12 The moisture that you're talking about really has nothing to do with draining it or wringing it out. When it's heated, the cell structure breaks down and the water in the cells is released. Since it's predominately water, that means you have a lot of moisture on your pizza to make your crust soggy. At the restaurant I used to work at we had two methods. If there wasn't going to be a lot of spinach on the pizza, then we would just put it on raw. If there was going to be a lot of it, then we would give it a quick saute and then put it on the pizza. I would do the same thing with squash, eggplant, etc. Anything with a high moisture content. You could also roast it first. In both cases, I wouldn't cook it for long as the goal is to just get most of the water out and then let it finish on the pizza in the oven. Answer ID: 36753 Score: 7 There are at least three different styles of 'spinach pies' that I've had (that were pizza, and not other types of 'pie'): Spinich is cooked fully before adding to the pizza. Often is saut\u00e9d with garlic and other seasonings. Spinich is added fresh to the pizza before it's cooked. Spinich is added fresh to the pizza after it's cooked. I'm not going to say that any one is particularly right or wrong. I grew up with the first style (I guess I'll call it 'Philadelphia style' for lack of a better designation, as we always had it when visiting my great-grandmother in South Philly). I've had it with tomato sauce, but it'd be more common to be a white pizza with sliced tomatoes The third one seems to be a more California type thing, but I've also had fresh greens on pizza ~20 years ago at Generous George's (when they were still on Duke Street in Alexandria, VA). It only really works with baby spinach or other tender greens. I've never been impressed with the middle one. I suspect it requires really knowing the heat of your oven so that it cooks the spinich just right in the same time it takes the rest of the pie to cook. You also want to put it above any cheese, so that the moisture gets a chance to evaporate rather than just being held in. Answer ID: 36749 Score: 4 I find the best results from super-brief blanching. Drop washed spinach in boiling water for about 5 seconds, drain quickly, shock in ice water, squeeze out water (I use a sushi mat), chop if desired. When baked for typical pizza cooking time (90sec-12 minutes depending on style) the color stays vibrant, the flavor is generally not bitter, and it doesn't dry out. Young spinach can be ok without blanching; it doesn't dry out if kept underneath the cheese, for example. But I think the visual effect and flavor is more pleasant when spinach is blanched. Answer ID: 42707 Score: 3 I just baked the baby spinach pizza with uncooked spinach under shredded cheese. It didn't come out soggy but some of the leaf edges were dry. Also, even though the spinach was piled high, there wasn't as much of it as I would like after it cooked down. Next time I will try using thinly sliced cheese over the spinach leaving just enough space between the slices for steam to escape. I used a thick tomato sauce, and baked on a pizza stone in a 475\u00b0 oven. The overall result was good. Answer ID: 36745 Score: 1 I would wash the spinach and put it in a hot pan to wilt (the moisture from the washing is all it needs), then add it to the cooked pizza when it comes out of the oven. The heat of an oven, especially a hot, pizza-cooking oven, will just destroy it.

Question tags: <doctor-who> Accepted answer ID: None Score: 7 In The Stolen Earth / Journey's End , Dalek Caan famously said  one will still die . Did he mean Davros or Donna? </s>Answer ID: 31990 Score: 11 Earlier in the episode, Dalek Caan says, The Children of Time will gather. And one of them will die! I always believed the Children of Time were the three Time Lords in this episode. Though it's perfectly reasonable to think that it means the Doctor's companions. I highly doubt it refers to a group that includes Davros. none of the Doctor's companions die, and only one of the Time Lords dies (The Doctor-Donna) one can assume he meant Donna, no matter which definition you have for the Children of Time. Seeing that they are his , this clearly rules out Davros, and makes it much more likely that The Children of Time refers to his companions. Answer ID: 31987 Score: 4 He meant Donna; he had been specifically talking about the Doctor's companions when he said that more than once. He's also not the only person to foresee Donna's death in some form or another. He was being figurative, of course; it was only the new, more mature Donna that died by forgetting the past year or so of her life. Answer ID: 32322 Score: 2 From what I gather Caan meant Donna, the enlightened Donna. The Donna that the doctor knew and traveled with, the Donna that developed from their time together is dead. While she is not physically gone the consciousness that she had become is pretty much dead. Even if she was reminded of that time she spent with the Doctor her physical body would die from the mental overload, so at that point both her and her Doctor-filled consciousness she was would perish. Answer ID: 35861 Score: 2 I had always assumed he meant meta-crisis ten, given the way he laughed about it at the end. Especially after he mentions that one will still die. I suppose that technically Doctor Donna dies, but also technically does not. We see that Donna's memories can come back, hinting that Doctor Donna is still there, just hidden. Plus, with meta-crisis ten now being human, and in the alternate timeline, he can (and will) certainly die for good. One of them could easily mean one of the doctors. Answer ID: 35887 Score: 1 I'm inclined to believe that Dalek Caan was referring to himself - by the actions of the Doctor, he was forced to take actions that resulted in his unprotected flight through the Time Vortex , this being how he penetrated the Time Lock and acquired his powers of prophecy. In my view, this, especially combined with his conclusions from seeing all of the Daleks' history, constitutes a metaphorical rebirth which more than qualifies him as a child of time. Being left behind on the Crucible, his death is all but guaranteed. Answer ID: 35930 Score: 1 Now that I think back on it, my personal opinion on this is that he wasn't talking about the Doctor or Donna at all, but instead he was talking about the Master and the Doctor in the upcoming episodes. I form this opinion in that he said The Children of Time I agree this most likely means Time Lords but instead of the Doctor and Donna, who isn't actually a full Time Lord, I think that it was meant to be the Doctor and the Master who were both portrayed as the youngest Time Lords still alive. This would still make sense because in The End of Time special, [SPOILER] In The End of Time The master is attempting to bring Gallifrey back and ultimately gets him self killed off (presumably for good this time) fulfilling One will still die. Answer ID: 49339 Score: 1 I think he was referring to Donna, because she did not physically die but she is no longer one of the Doctor's Children of Time. So in one way or another she did die. Answer ID: 49569 Score: 1 I used to think that it referred to Donna but have since changed my thoughts to the prophecy referring to Sara Jane, the only companion who actually did die and was also the most loyal, being with Pertwee and then Baker. She never gave up on the Doctor even after he left her and then in 2006 she was brought back and was as loyal to the Doctor as she had always been and helped save the Earth (as well as securing her own spin-off series . Regretfully Sladen passed away in 2011. Perhaps the prophecy was a subtle reference to her illness as it was only a few years later that she actually died and consequently her on-screen character Sarah Jane (the most loyal companion) also died.
