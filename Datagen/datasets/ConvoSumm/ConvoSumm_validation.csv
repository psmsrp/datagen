Subreddit: reddevils I personally can't see it happening...I can't think of a player who is currently available that would actually improve our first team. I don't want more players, I want the players we already have to play to their potential. I think we have to sign a centre back. We were linked with miranda in the summer, he's currently not playing as much with atletico. Why not go for him? Him and rojo CB partnership, better than two of smalling, jones, evans I see that the club WANTS to sign a CB, but there's no one of quality to sign in this window. That aside, a fully fit CB pairing getting a run of games would probably be as good as a new signing (hell, we thrashed Arsenal 8-2 with Jones/Smalling as CBs) That was also with Cleverly and Anderson in midfield! Im just waiting for the day when we sign Clyne the rest of our defenders probably nothings gonna happen I admire your optimism on that one So who, pray tell, would the CBs be in this solid world class English back line? Cos you sure as shit couldn't mean Jones or Smalling. And what does it matter if our back line is all English? Blame it on the early hour we have the players fit, to play an effective diamond system. question is, will LvG deploy it? ne of the key critique's of the diamond was the defensive vulnerability. Against Leicester, we had blackett operating as an LCB, a position he is wholly incompetent playing in. If we have Smalling and Rojo as our CBs and shaw operating in his favoured LB role, we will have far more stability than with a back three. Moreover, the diamond has brought the best out of players like herrera, adm and blind, whereby, they're effectively utilised. We have the proper players fit, don't need to buy anyone specific just now, just need to play the right system Judging by basically no rumors at all, I would say no. Very rare to find any quality in January, especially with the seeming lack of quality defenders on the market in general. Might as well wait until summer. there are a lot of rumours, just nothing credible :P Thats what I meant by basically no rumors at all. All this Messi talk or Hummels in january is nonsense. Another Spaniard to encourage DDG to sign a new contract I'd be very surprised Very concerning If it means that we are already working on big signings for the summer, I would actually be calmed by not signing anyone now. We are currently a borderline Champions League team and there's a hefty chance that our immediate rivals will use this window to strengthen. I can't imagine Woodward will choose to be frugal in this instance given how the costs of potentially missing out on the Champions League vastly supersedes that of our potential spending this window. We put ourselves in a much stronger position in the summer if we are back in the Champions League. It means we can sit at the table with the likes of Marco Reus. I'm not so sure we can be too patient in this instance when there are various reasonable options to improve. we should* wait, but just pointing out that it could lead to better results. I am honestly a bit worried that we haven't even been linked with any plausible signings yet, and we are two weeks in already. * I haven't seen much of Schar but from everything I've seen/read, I would love to see him signed now for the summer since I believe his contract is up. Anybody know more about him? * Don't really see us signing a big time player in this window unfortunately. Would love to see someone like Strootman because he can provide the physicality Fellaini gives, while also adding much more technical ability. Don't think it happens til the summer. * Would like Coleman or Clyne but also don't see either happening until the summer if at all. Valdez had been rumoured a while ago and was a free agent, so that's different to signing a player and cashing up for him. We certainly need a CB and a CM and a young striker maybe. but I doubt we will get it in this window, simply because most players of the right quality won't want to leave their team mid season. The only thing I'd take short term is a CM and if we have our sights set on Strootman it would be a huge waste. Reus would be nice. I believe we need one or two players. But january is tricky. We should only spend for the right players, and if they're not available, wait till summer."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: dyinglight I beat the game and would like to know about the following: How do I get better weapons? Should I allow invasions? How do I level up my agility and stuff faster?

Survivor 25 will drop 1000+ weapons regularly. Yes, invasions should be allowed. Start now so you get a better hang of how to fight a Night Hunter. 1v1 when you're new can be frustrating, but its worth it for the experience. Demolishers also drop great weapons. Of course, the lock picking and very hard chests/police vans you see. That will give you a plethora of purple to orange weapons. At the top of this sub is a tab called 'Wiki'. Tons of information is in that post and is probably a good place to start. There are a few guides on power/agility farming - and yes, they do happen at night. Harran *is* Old Towns + Slums. Better weapons/blue prints can be found in Old Town. That is the higher level area. I do like to go to Slums once in a while, but Old Town is generally where I hang out. You can fast travel between locations. Inside the main tower of Old Town, where the bed and stash is a picture of the Tower. You can fast travel there.

For me the cooler was just added piece of mind, since i've had several bad experiences due to overheating components, but since I don't plan on overclocking this should be good. The stock cooler is quiet and will keep you under 65oC even when stress testing, which is 40oC away from the max temp the processor can put up with. An extra $36 just to have it modular? Forget about it; the 400D has good enough cable management that you can hide the extra cables of a 500W non-modular with ease. Primarily the idea behind the PSU suggestion was 80plus Bronze certified > 80plus certification. I saw the OP used the Single merchant : Newegg option in PartPicker, therefore I choose this option, too. Prices of the build and of the PSU are usually lower. The normal CX500 is 80+ Bronze too, it just doesn't say so on PCPartPicker. The ASRock Extreme4 is a reasonably poor motherboard due to the MOSFETs it uses. It's also brown all over, so there's that too. You do, however, get 8GB of memory with it for free, so if you keep with the Extreme4, you won't need any other RAM. If you're buying a Z77 motherboard in the first place, you should by purchasing an unlocked processor, and conversely, if you're not planning to overclock, you don't need an aftermarket cooler or a Z77 motherboard. The graphics card you've chosen is also overpriced (you can pick up a HD7950 for $275, or a HD7870XT for $240). The graphics card comes with both Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite, which I planned on buying anyways, so its not a huge deal to me if i have to pay a little bit more. Most HD7950's (if not all) should come with Crysis 3 and Bioshock Infinite, and most HD7870XT's (if not all) should come with Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite. Get a unlocked CPU or get rid of the cooler and grab a b75 or h77 mobo. I'd try to get a SSD and go with whealman's tips. Drop the aftermarket cooler. The i5-3470 is a Ivy Bridge, that stock runs fine on the stock cooler. Will I see a significant difference in boot speed with an SSD? no boot speeds shouldnt be effected by your hardware at all. at this point only the operating system will Boot speed is almost entirely affected by hardware.

Thank you very much, that is just what I need and it doesn't look to difficult. Not sure if there's a name for the method, but [this](http://gizmodo.com/5872456/this-mindblowing-photo-of-a-world-map-in-a-water-drop-is-real) guy seems to know what he's doing. There's a picture at the bottom of the article that gives an idea of his setup. If you can find the original reddit thread (probably linked in the article) I'm sure someone there explained it a little better. I'd seen that image before , It was a sort of inspiration for the idea I have. You didn't dream it but I don't know what it would be called other than water droplet. The first time I saw it was in Popular Photography in the late 70s or early 80s. I remember the tips being to make sure the glass was perfectly level so the drops stay round. And using glycerin instead of water makes for a fuller, rounder drop. They applied it to the glass with a misting spray bottle. Use aperture and distance of glass from the subject to control background focus, perspective, and view. I'm not aware that it has a name. It's a pretty common technique, though. I don't know what it's called I would love to know your easy technique, It's only a short project and I don't have time to try lengthy methods. Apply Rain-x to a piece of clear acrylic or glass(glass is clearer) and shoot it from directly above. The Rain-x causes the water to lose surface adhesion and make nearly perfect beads. I usually light these rigs with a halogen shop light through a bed sheet diffuser. : Put the water on with a drinking straw. melt one end closed and poke a hole in the side near the sealed off end with a sewing needle. Cover and uncover the hole you made to control flow and get the drops the size you want. Thank you very much, I was going to ask for an alternative to an external flash but you solved that for me straight away. Shooting through a clear and reflective surface and trying to light with a strobe without reflections or glare is an exercise in frustration. And perhaps it is obvious, but you'd probably want a macro lens to get the short focus distance and nice background blurring/bokeh. It's called Refraction... or Refraction Photography.

I'd go modular if you can afford the extra I don't regret it building was such a breeze! I picked up some extra fans for my computer and realized I would have to clear my mess of cables in order to put a fan down there. It went well though and now my PC looks nice and clean inside. Though if I had to do it again I would provably try for modular. It really does just depend on the case. Brands like corsair and nzxt usually put in holes in the back so you can route cables to the back and make them disappear haha. Which case are you planning on going for? I think i will just try to make the cables fit any way i can without breaking anything. Yea there should be space in front of your PSU that you can bundle up extra cables and leave them sitting there without them being in the way really. I have a Define R4 and there is enough room to route the extra and a few others between the back wall and the wall supporting the motherboard. depends on the case. the one ive got, the NZXT H440, has a psu cover that can house all the extra cables and it will all look clean still (in theory). Or if you dont mind a bit of a rats nest, I guess youll be fine. What is the price on that case? 109 roughly. I got it through tigerdirect Nice case a little out of my price range though. Im looking at the Thermaltake Commander MS-I Epic Edition. Its in my price range and looks cool. Modular PSUs are helpful when you're building in a small case, or if you have a windowed case and want your rig to look neat. Otherwise a non-modular PSU is perfectly fine. If im getting a windowed case can i still make it look nice by putting the extra cables in the back panel of the case? Modular PSU's arn't that much more expensive, to my knowledge. What power rating are you looking at? I'm concerned that you might be tempted to buy a cheap PSU - don't. Make sure you buy something that's branded, preferably Corsair or similar. I have had crappy PSUs explode on me in the past. The PSU is probably the most important part in the case. Additionally, look for high efficiency, it'll save money on your electricity bill."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

It's still OK later on in some situations, but most of the time it's better to just more AP. but a couple of patches after release someone did the math and figured you actually get more from morello I was talking about the time where people would build morello into something (void, dcap, whatever) into stinger into more AP- Well, people went Stinger imo because they didn't know how to build him when he was new, i guess when Ludens came out people just starting going that instead, because it's a good powerspike and it's stronger, and with runes and masteries you already got 40% cdr scaling, the whole point on going CDR is to reach 40%. Also, scaling = flat at lvl 9. scaling is better since Azir W scale with lvl on most mid champion scaling rune in yellow+blue are the best scaling blues get you CDR capped with masteries and 1 item which is pretty huge on azir 4 cdr/lvl + 5 ap if you take 3 points into the cdr mastery and want to cap with blue 9cdr/lvl if you just want to stay at 38.% (or 40% if you take 5% cdr masteries and dont take arcane blade) lategame without a blue flat cdr is pretty meh, azir doesnt really shine till mid-lategame and flat cdr doesnt exactly help him reach that state better, his early game is save as it is and doesnt need help from runes usually http://www.probuilds.net/guide/KR/1938211505/1135567 Scaling CDR Blues to get 15% + 5% from Masteries, 20% from Morello/Athenes to get to 40% hybrid pene red hp MR blues or yolo Ap/lvl AP quins only run MR blues if you're against high kill pressure high burst champ like LB/fizz or an annoying poke spammers like cassio that you know for sure you can't outplay.

I can't afford to get the AVR, speakers, and sub all at once, so I'd like to get a few things at a time. The current speakers are tiny things, so could I get a pair of decent speakers (from the buyers guide) and use those as the front LR speakers? Is the centre channel more important? The Panasonic receiver doesn't appear to use standard plugs for the speakers, but I assume I could slice the cord and join the odd plugs to some new speakers? As you get more money the miccas would transition to rear speakers & you'd replace your Front L C R plus add a sub What is your max starting budget? My budget would be blown on a receiver, which is why I'm keeping my eye out on eBay and Craigslist. I don't mind it being several years old as long as it has 3 HDMI in and dts-hd. I figured some bigger speakers first to continue using the current receiver and get a decent benefit. Again you still haven't listed your budget I can't help w/out that I'd be willing to spend about \u00a3100 (UK) right now, which I know won't get me much. Maybe push to \u00a3150 for something great. My issue is that spending straight away on a receiver probably leaves me without anything for a single speaker. that is a pretty tight budget. the impedance as /u/shrivel said. Don't want you to blow your AVR. I'd look at some second hand Denon or Yamaha receivers. I've found on Gumtree a 5.1 set with AV receiver for \u00a3200. Wharfedale 9.0 speakers, matching centre and sub, Onkyo 507 receiver as well as wires and stands. I know the 9.0 aren't ideal for main speakers, and I have my eye on a pair of 9.1 on eBay, but the above system should beat the crap out of the current DVD player (HTiaB?) I'm pushing my budget because it's a complete system that would take me a while to work to otherwise. The speakers and sub seem to justify the price, with a receiver as well. Receiver is only HDMI 1.3a, but it accepts all the DTS-HD MA and Dolby I want. Yeah i would do that you can upgrade it over time It'll surely beat the socks off the current HTiaB right? Absolutely I would suggest replacing the speakers first, and yes, you should be able to just cut the ends off the existing wires and use them with the new speakers. Be mindful of impedance differences - in-a-box systems often have high impedance speakers combined with low wattage amps. It's typically okay to use different speakers with the amp, but maybe not the other way around. if this is easily Google-able, but if I understand correctly: A high impedance speaker (I guess better quality?) plugged into a low wattage amp would just be quieter, but work fine? Whereas a high wattage amp plugged into a low impedance speaker would maybe go boom? The Panasonic is apparently 1000W RMS total, which is on the high side of things I saw, so obviously I don't really believe it. How do I find how this breaks up per channel? The manual? The only real number you'll need to pay attention to is the impedance of the speakers. If your present speakers are 6 ohm, 4 ohm or 2 ohm trying to drive them with most receivers these days might be problematic, since most basic amps are designed for 8 ohm loads. Some may go down to 4, but those will be more expensive generally. that wattage rating on the amp - it's BS. problematic? As in blow them up?

Another commenter gives details of their sound setup and the equipment used."", ""dialog history"": ""Title: Let's talk risers Subreddit: edmproduction We talk a lot about drops and theory and sound design, but what do you guys do to make risers really stand out? I don't think theyre necessarily supposed to stand out, instead give a feeling of direction and movement and tension. I meant what people do to add interest to their riser , I think I meant stand out from other risers. One thing i like to do is make a bandpass filter on the sound, have an LFO on the filter, and make the LFO speed go up as the tension in the track increases. Another good thing is to make the pitch go up continuously somehow, whether you use slide notes or straight up automate it. I will also automate volume, for obvious reasons. You should try automating the prism from all the way to the left to all the way to the right, as well as increasing phaser speed. That's what I do a lot I forgot about automating phaser speed, that's also great to do. (IIRC, I'm not at my computer) having the pan turned all the way down and the phase in neutral position will create an LFO'y effect when you turn up the unison pitch. I think risers can really make or break a track in terms of cohesion. Use envelope 1, and pitch OSC 1 -12 down. Change the level and decay in the envelope to fit the timing. Use the LFO to change the pitch +1 on OSC 1 to give it that wobbly woehie effect lot uses in progressive house etc. Set a Reverb effect and use envelope 1 to modulate the size so it becomes more reverby once it approaches the drop. Use the same LFO you have used to change pitch, to change panning. Automate it so that it becomes more mono once it approaches the drop. If awesome, use some filters for more modulation or some white noise which increases volume once it approaches the drop. Then ALWAYS bounce the track and reverse it, this always can give it such a cool and original effect. Hope I have been a little bit useful for a basic basic riser and NEVER forget to break the rules and try shit out. Grammar I feel this gives me way more control over the pitch and I dont have to deal with clumsy automation curves through whatever synth youre using Also Id recommend not using a built-in reverb in the synth. Use an external one, that way you can control where in the effect chain the reverb gets used. Also they tend to have more control in all aspects. Actually one thing i recommend is to set up a custom effect rack with a bunch of effects that pushes out the sound (washes it out). Essentially a reverb, high pass and delay, maybe some other stereo plugins and some volume autmation, all linked to one macro knob. [Bass Kleph made an Ableton one and put it out for free](http://www.djtechtools.com/2013/12/10/free-ableton-plugin-bass-kleph-easy-wash-out/), and personally I took inspiration from that one to make my own (much easier to modify when you understand how everything in the rack is built up). But I have to be honest, the reverb in massive just sounds soooooo good with its own internal sounds. I actually kind of agree with you, the massive one has its niche at least. Just SO annoying that you cant put it later in the effect chain, if so id use it way more. Ive just been trying to get used to sort of emulating it with other reverbs, valhalla gets pretty close with the right high/low passing. Yeah true, its quite annoying that you cant high pass the reverb in massive so you don't spread your lows sound all over the place one thing i like to do is sample weird vocals and turn them into playable instruments and make a riser out of those with a lot of processing, or to take it one deeper you can use that as a vocoder signal for some crazy synth patch (I like to use nuero bass patches) and apply any number of filters / distortion / effects then just make a simple pitch riser out of said crazy sound. filter it to fit into your mix and it'll add some gnarly energy to ur track make an ill synth and then make it rise with pitch bend instead of note automation. Then I layer a sample in my sampler and make it rise with pitch automation too and boom instant trap banger breh I use lots of noise sweeps and reversed crashes, but one thing I figured out on my own (one of the only things I've figured out on my own, rather) is to take two sine oscillator and pitch the second a few cents lower than the first. This will create a slow pulsing in the volume. Then I just modulate the pitch up, and as the pitch rises, the constructive/destructive interference oscillates faster and faster, which gives a really cool effect. You can experiment too. maybe use saws, or throw on a filter lfo, who knows. That's just a starting point. I use massive for all my risers because of the simplicity of the macros. I usually just have one note held for however many bars i need then automate the pitch and sometimes an LFO or I will setup the performer the the amplitude with a repeated saw to make it more rhythmic.

(apparently location data didn't save as I didn't have location lock at the time) It's one block north and two blocks east of Citic Plaza, you've gotta walk into the middle of the block though as it's not on any of the main roads. * [Google maps, pin is on a neighbouring business](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/ Tianshe+Shaozhou+Bar/@23.1441117,113.3298805,20z [Their old website, phone numbers current but for their old address / shop](http://www.frappessa.com/a/gb2312/index.html) The place actually doubles as a barista school, they were training a group of people in the back of the shop while we were sitting in there. They do espresso, drip coffees and Aeropress too, which is handy because I wanted to buy beans for the Aeropress I have at home. I had a Columbian coffee they had there (drip) and it was delicious, after that they actually let me behind the bar and I made a few coffees and tried a few others, and all the staff there were awesome! Absolutely blown away by that place, I came home with a couple of bags of beans and will definitely be back there soon. Apparently the school's been around for 11 years but they've only been at the current location a short while, but it's really nicely done inside. If you're a fan of coffee be sure to check it out! Imgur s blocked for non VPN users. We're opening one up as we speak. Sadly only our 1kg roaster is currently in China. The other 2 production roasters are getting loaded into cargo containers. First order of beans en route, couple latins, couple african beans, ect. Would love to, as long as its ok by the mods/community. Assuming you're also opening a cafe along with it, where is it? We'll have a coffee bar for the curious, but our main slate is whole sale. With that said, we're bringing in two antique roasters from abroad so it's kind of hard not to want to show them off. Free cups a joe for reddittors <3 Sounds cool. Sounds pretty cool. I actually had a similar experience at another cafe called Bank, at \u4f53\u80b2\u897f\u6a2a\u8857115\u53f7 (Tiyu Xi Hengjie) They roast out the front of their shop, and played around with me with their aeropress. Another one is Rose Cafe, between Ximenkou and Gongyuanqian metro stations. The address is \u60e0\u5409\u897f\u8def14\u53f7 (14 Huiji Xilu). It's kinda hard to find but definitely worth it. I've bought beans from both of these places, but from Bank only once. They have lots of different ones to choose from and they roasted them right when I ordered. Both places have a great range. I've found a few others that I'll definitely provide some links to later. on coffee roasters, please post any more that you can recommend."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: dirtgame Some time after I started playing the game in the end of last year I joined the Reddit League. It showed up in the game but I couldn't join any event. Went to dirtgame.com and checked, it said season had ended. Every time I checked, the result was the same, so the league seemed dead. Now with the release of 1.1 I expected the league action to increase again so I can finally try it out. I joined 4 more leagues, all from the Suggested, Popular Leagues and all with thousands of members. Still, when I launch the game, I can see the leagues but there is nothing to join. When I check dirtgame.com it says season has ended for all leagues. Never have I seen any active event in any league. What happened? Did leagues on PC really die out completely? They're alive and well, but not all run all the time. I found that if I joined just a couple there were times where no events were going on, so I joined more (and more...). Here are some I just assumed that the most popular ones with thousands of members would be running often, but apparently I was wrong. Also check /r/simrally league In case you mean the reddit_simrally league that is in the list of the most popular leagues, and I am a member of that league already. I have never seen an active event in it. Thanks a lot for those links, its tough to find an active league. I was able to finally get an active league to join in game. Unfortunately I can still not play it. After loading the first stage, I am kicked out and get a message saying Racenet is not available. It won't become available until I close and restart the game. But after every restart when I try to enter the league and have loaded the first stage, I get kicked out of Racenet. That's weird. Does it give you a specific error when it dumps you out? Yeah, I got something like Racenet servers not currently available or similar. Also when I tried to rejoin, or tried to load online events, I would immediately get the same message, until I restarted the game. However yesterday I went back later and tried joining the league, and then it worked. Then I rolled of a cliff in Monte on the third stage Haven't tried joining a leauge again since then. I also have problems to find active leagues. It's mostly just luck to finf an active one. Is there a way to select on this? coincidentally i made a post about it earlier I thought something might have been broken but i didn't see anyone else talk about it. There's the [legendary one](https://www.dirtgame.com/leagues/league/34459/drc---legendary) going on right now. 24 stages, 270km, three service stages."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Sorry if this is bad formatting just quickly whipped it up for your opinions. Blinds 3000 6000 Hero is dealt Qs 9s. Pre flop: Villian calls 6000. Hero bets 16000. Button folds. Villian calls 16000 As 9c 10s (32000) Villain bets 20000 Hero ??? Shove but I imagine this is the sort of game where you get told off for doing that Shove. Everyone is <10bb and you have pair and a flush draw. It's going to be hard to find a better spot than that this short stacked. Even if you're behind you have 14 outs (assuming your Q is live) and that means you're the statistical favorite. And if you're behind, there are a lot of hands that beat you that would fold to your shove if they aren't thinking about their stack sizes (and someone who limps with < 10bb isn't thinking about stack sizes) like 2nd pair or sometimes TPWK. Even if you're behind you have 14 outs (assuming your Q is live) and that means you're the statistical favorite. Think he means if you are up vs top pair that isnt AQ eg your two pair outs are live and your flush outs are live, you're pretty close to 50/50 depending on whether he has AJ/AK or A8 or worse, also depending on his suits etc. with 14 outs you have like a 56% chance of hitting the two pair, trip nines or flush by the river. Heads up winning 56% percent of the time is what he means. not exactly sure how you have 14 outs as 56% to win, but my point was that if you're in a situation where you're more than 50% to win the hand you are not behind.  even if you haven't made your hand yet, you are still ahead. wasnt doing math when I did the comment, just an estimation 14 outs is actually 51.15 percent, not far off. But this is us counting the turn and river together. What the OP meant by being behind at the time was at the moment you have a worse hand. But yes, I see your point, if you have more than 50% you are a favorite even if behind. this is really just semantics and there's no need for me to be so pedantic. but you are either a favorite or you're behind. you're not behind if you are 50%+ to win the hand. There is a difference between being a favorite and being ahead. On the other side, there is a difference between being behind and being a dog. Made vs unmade ahead vs behind If the Miami Heat is playing against a Catholic middle school team in basketball and the middle school team scores the first basket, the Heat are behind. They are still an overwhelming favorite to win, but at that moment they are behind. Shove preflop. Q9s may sound great 3-handed, but no player has more than 10BB. I would not play any hand that I didn't intend to shove preflop here, and since Villain has shown an intent to play the hand (by calling) a shove won't get the fold equity you need and will always call with the hands that beat you (pocket pairs, Ax, Kx.) You are also the player at risk when you do so. Also, raising to 16000 pot-commits you. You cannot fold after putting that money in the pot, so I think a raise like that is probably the worst move. Shove > Raise. As played: Postflop, you're pot committed with a pair plus a flush draw. Shove, expect to be behind Ax, and hope you hit your draw."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: smallbusiness My accountant convinced me to classify my small business(of which, I'm the only shareholder and only employee) as a corporation, but it didn't turn a profit last year(the first year in business). I didn't pay myself, and after expenses pretty much just broke even. Am I supposed to pay myself and just put the money back in? When I file taxes and show that no employees were paid, is this going to send up a red flag with the IRS? I would think the IRS would be more concerned if your the single owner/employee of the company and you DID cut yourself a paycheck. That would be a red flag because it would look like you are running the business just to write off the losses on your taxes. But I am by far and wide NO tax lawyer How would taking a paycheck allow him to write off losses on his taxes? you claim the loss, if your company pulls in 100k in a year and you pay yourself 75k and operating expenses were 90k for the year you'd be looking at a 65k loss. rather than a 10k loss. >rather than a 10k loss. Do you mean a 10k gain? 100-90? Company has 100k in revenue Company spends 90k in operating expenses Company pays sole employee 75k. In order to do this, someone (the sole employee) has to loan the business 65k. Employee owner now has 75k in income that he has to pay taxes on Business now has a 65k liability that it has to pay back at some point. How does that benefit him? He basically loaned himself money and then had to pay taxes on it. In the future I assume he'd have the business pay him back + interest, which he'll have to pay taxes on as well. i made one math error yes, but what i was saying was it was stupid and by paying yourself money you're just going to put back into your company you're devaluing your company. If you're worried about flagging the IRS for an audit, it sounds like you have other problems. If, on the other hand, you're just worried about how you're filing your taxes for the company, it doesn't matter which way you're doing it. You'll get double taxed if you pay yourself and then reinvest the money, but since you're the only board member, you get to choose. As long as the company isn't blowing money on personal expenses and then writing those off, you're fine. There are so many reasons that the IRS flags people and their small business division does a majority of the audits. Wanting to do everything I can to not be audited and avoid the headache is my only other problem. I almost didn't post this question because it seems like every tax question gets the what do you have to worry about response. I'd like it to be done correctly and to know which way that is. I think you are probably ok. I have an s-corp, but I've never dealt with not making a profit. I'm guessing you'll need to treat any profit at the end of the year as income on your personal tax returns. The upside to forming an s-corp for a 1 man business is that when your business DOES make money, you don't have to claim it all as employment income. For example, lets say you run a plumbing business and you have a really good year and make a profit of 200k. You could be justified in paying yourself a salary of say 60k, and taking the 140k as a profit distribution. You don't have to pay the same taxes on the 140k as on the 60k (specifically all the employment type taxes). What IS a red flag is if your business makes a large profit, but you intentionally pay yourself a very small profit. If you are a lawyer and your s-corp made 500k, but you paid yourself only 20k as an employee, you might be looking at a call from the IRS. I've seen far too many people coming on here thinking about starting or have started and assume their suppose to incorporate. I guess I was a tad concerned you got roped into something sooner than you needed be concerned with it. That being said with what you described a corp does make sense, but after having a corp I have strong reservations against them and would likely prefer an LLC. I can say looking at the short term I would have preferred an LLC, but long term the corp status does look better for where I'll be by the end of the year(if things Hopefully, it will work out that way. Be very careful to manage your growth. Too fast can be very destructive if you are not already use to managing a company it's size. Because you have to live, you can't live on no money forever. So in theory, if you aren't taking a paycheck (from your company or anywhere else) you have to be making money under the table in order to eat, pay your mortgage, etc. I haven't heard of anyone actually being audited for it though. I'm more concerned with why your accountant suggested you should incorporate. Do you plan on having staff and I mean more than just 1-3 people? As an individual you have a greater tax advantage as a sole prop. Regardless you'd want liability insurance, so the protection a corp offers is negated by the insurance you'd have for the biz. Having corporate taxes done cost more in comparison and unless your long term plan isn't including a large operation you may want to get a second opinion if a corporation status is really in your best interest. no read flags for not reporting an income. Yes, the mid-long term plan is to have multiple locations with 2-3 employees per location.

Subreddit: explainlikeimfive * it could still recuperate * it could startstop fuel engine from time to time (it would power the wheels and charge the batteries, then stop and start again when batteries are drained) so the engine would be at almost constant RPM/load = more fuel economy * car wouldn't need complex mechanical systems for distribution of mechanical power so it would be propably much lighter and simpler * stability control, abs, esp, etc. would have direct access to wheel rotation speeds and could adjust them on the fly as needed I consider fully electric 4WD drive with engine per wheel as the greatest way to drive a car, so I would expect that this is what we would be building, but for current state of batteries with power generator. Instead, we still have engine directly linked to wheels. I can imagine some power loss on electric generator part, but I would expect it to be compensated by fuel efficiency of engine and by simpler and lighter car overall. What you're describing is an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV), that is a car that gets all its motor force from electric motors but also has some generation capacity onboard to increase its range. EREVs exist, two examples being the Chevy Volt and BMW i3. The reason they don't do 4wd or use multiple motors is because motors are really heavy and expensive, so you're probably looking at adding thousands of dollars to the cost of the car and several hundred pounds vs using a single larger motor and a transmission/transaxle. The nature of electric cars is that if you want non-trivial range at a decent price you have to make them pretty light, and makes things like 4wd counter productive. I have trouble googling more comparisons between hybrids and that, but I would still guess that 200bhp electric engine isn't that much lighter than 4 50bhp engines, especially when it needs differentials and stuff like that) Also, on that wiki page, they don't list any drawbacks, nor am I able to google those. By my search it would seem that my proposal actually should be the most typical car design (4WD or not). The 2WD version of the kind of system you're talking about is seen in DIY electric setups. It is mechanically a much simpler system, and it tends to be physically easier for a DIYer to handle multiple smaller motors than one large one. Still wondering why modern hybrids aren't like that though. Could you explain me what exactly the difference with the hybrid cars we know would be? Do you want to split the electric engine and fuel engine to one of each for each wheel? Current hybrid cars power cars by fuel engine AND electric engine Their wheels are mechanically connected to combustion engine. I am proposing a car that has four electric engines, one for each wheel, next to said wheel that just happens to get its electric energy from combustion generator (instead of some battery or nuclear reactor:). Combustion doesn't move the car. So you would suggest having a combustion engine charge a battery that powers 4 individual electrical engines? If you're using a combustion engine anyways, why would you not use it directly on the wheels? Now you're only losing efficiency by transforming it to electrical energy first. You can use the electric engine(s) on your own now as well , you can turn off the combustion engine just fine. It doesn't seem likely that it would be more efficient for day to day Well, when you still use combustion engine, you have to have mechanical energy transfer. If you want to do that for four wheels, it is quite heavy. If you want different wheel speeds and stuff like that, you need differentials. I don't want to list everything but it just adds up and electric car (with 4 motors) is incredibly simple yet extremely powerful solution with much higher flexibility when it comes to stability control and such. You just need something to feed it with the energy... and since we cannot have nuclear cars, I could imagine some reasonably effective power generator. You seem to be describing a [series hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle_drivetrain#Series_hybrid) arrangement. Just to make sure, are you suggesting that a car with 5 engines + battery would be lighter than a car with just one engine? * Electric engines are considerably smaller than normal engines. It also wouldn't have things like gearbox, clutch, differential, brakes... I am comparing it to current hybrids / hybrid supercars, not to standard combustion cars."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

,ConvoSumm--val--37,37,"{""summary"": ""Most commenters explain that the reason you either pay taxes in April or get a refund is that the money withheld from your check each pay period is just a guess at how much you owe in taxes for that year. Many commenters seem to see a difference in taxes owed and taxes paid as an interest-free loan going either to you or to the government. One commenter seems to use his tax refund as a kind of piggybank, purposely paying more to get a bigger refund."", ""dialog history"": ""Title: If taxes are taken out of each of my paychecks, how come I need to pay taxes again every April? Subreddit: explainlikeimfive Because it's an *estimation If you look on a tax form 1040, there are a ton of other issues that will reduce or increase your liability. Did you get married? What is your filing status? Do you have itemized deduction (mortgage interest, medical expense). Did you get interest income, dividend, etc. Did your business make money? There are provisions for casualty loss, theft, tax credits. The list goes on and on and on. The IRS does not know all this. The taxes are taken out of your paycheck throughout the year. Ideally, they should be within 10% of what you are legally supposed to be taxed at. If your employer withheld too little, then you will owe taxes, and if they withheld too much, you will be owed. Using your W2, you can file with the 1040, noting important deductions. In most cases, people are actually owed money, but sometimes your withholdings are very off, and you will have to make up the difference. In April you 'true up' your taxes. If you owe money that means you paid less tax than you were supposed to all year. Therefore you got an interest free load from the government. * If you get a refund, that means you paid too much in tax all year. Thus you gave the government an interest free loan all year. So contrary to popular belief, it is actually financially better if on a macro scale if you ended up paying the government a little bit of money in April. When tax is taken out of your paycheck, it's guessing how much needs to be taken out. In April, you file your taxes for the whole year, to get the actual amount that you needed to take out. (This is also where you list deductions, exemptions and what not) They compare that amount to the estimate, and whatever the difference is, is what gives you either your tax return, which most people get, or you have to pay a bit extra to make up for it, which usually happens when you own your own business. It means you have your w4 filled out incorrectly. The idea is that you want them to withhold more money than what the taxes should be. This way, if you have taxable income which didn't have taxes deducted (such as lottery winnings), you're refund would be reduced by that amount instead of owing that much more. Yes, it is an interest-free loan to the government. But think about this: the interest you would have made off of keeping the refund in the bank (even a CD) should be no more than a few dollars. I'm willing to pay a few dollars to ensure I don't owe money to the IRS. Also, I like having a nice large refund at a predictable time of the year. you want a refund is to take as few exemptions on your w4 as possible. I even put in $10 as an additional amount to withhold from each check. This adds $520 to your taxes paid line on your 1040, assuming you get paid weekly, potentially making your refund bigger by up to $520. It's similar to putting a $20 bill in a jacket you know you won't be using for 6 months and promptly forgetting about it then rediscovering it later. You owe a portion of your total yearly income to the govt. You can either pay it little by little as you get your paycheck (most people do this) and then settle up at the end of the year if you haven't paid enough (additional taxes owed) or have paid too much (tax refund!) OR you can receive your entire pay check throughout the year and then owe the govt one large sum of money come April. Now, as I said, most people have money held out of their paycheck every month because of a number of reasons: it's the default, they are unable to save enough of their money to pay the lump sum, or they simply don't know what they're missing. That's because it is actually more economically prudent of you to not pay any taxes until the end of the year. You can earn interest on the money if you put it into a savings account. You can put a portion of your income away for retirement and get a tax deduction for it. There are other things you can do with your money that reduces your tax burden, but you can't do it if the govt already has this money in their account. Also, having to pay taxes in April is a *good* thing. If you get a refund, that means you just gave the government an interest free loan. If you pay, that means *you* got the loan.

I rarely use Steam Workshop even most games has it where I rather download directly from moddb, nexus or other sites. Well, anything would be better than the current, manual, situation Take a look at CKAN for KerbalSpaceProgram. The current method of modding isnt difficult at all. Cars to car folder. Tracks to track folder. It is just drag and drop all the time. Then, look up at race department every day to check new mods. It is not tedious or difficult. I rather have that than the confusing and user unfriendly UI of Steam Workshop. Have you updated the Formula Corsa mod at all? Install new version Note that the installation involves merging folders, so unless you are keeping track of what goes where, 1) is quite difficult >1) Install new version That is hard for you? It is essentially, go to the Cars folder and delete Formula Corsa. Then, drag and drop the new one in it. If it an update, drag and drop the updated files into Formula_Corsa folder and press yes to replace all. All the car mods goes into content/cars, all the track mods goes into content/tracks. Not like one file goes here, then, another goes there. If you want to delete a car, then, head to content/cars and delete that particular car. If you are not sure which car you are deleting, you can always go into the skins folder and look at the car's preview picture. I have over 15 mod cars in the game and tonnes of mod tracks, updating any mod in AC was never a problem. Assetto Corsa is by far the easiest game to mod. Have you even mod Skyrim/Fallout 3/Company of Heroes/rFactor/GSCE before? Those are even more complicated than AC by miles because there are compatibility issues involved, mod conflicts, mods not behaving in the way you like because you ruined something, unpacking the game with some dodgy looking extractor, mess with the slow JSGME mod manager, script extenders to install or .ini files to tweak. AC literally is the only game that I never screwed up the installation via modding because the game is designed to be extremely modular. Even if you done something wrong, most of the time, it is easy to track down what went wrong. Most of the codes and files in the game actually comes with helpful comments to tell you what each line does. The error reporting tool that comes with the game does provide some helpful hints on whats wrong. More importantly, I am not even a modder to begin with as I cant even port a car to AC. I am just some random guy who download mods from Race Department. Steam Workshop is still awful in managing multiple mods. Nexus Manager is by far better.

Subreddit: cars Hi there /r/cars, I was hoping you might be able to help me out with a question I have. Over the weekend my fiancee and I bought our first car together. It's a 5-speed Mazda 3. I took 1 lesson from a buddy in high school on how to drive manual, but it wasn't a successful lesson. So she drove it home. On the way home she was really making me nervous. Accelerating when there is a car stopped at a stop light and the distance between us and that car was only two or three car lengths. I asked her why she would accelerate towards a parked car and she said That's how you have to drive manual! At this point I was confused so I asked her to clarify. She said you have to accelerate and let off the gas in intervals to keep a constant speed. So the whole way home on the interstate she would accelerate a little past 60 and then let off the gas completely until it went back down to a bit below 60 and then she would repeat. I asked her if it's possible to just keep your foot on the gas a little bit to maintain a constant speed and she said no, it's not possible. So is she just having fun in our new car and messing with me? She's definitely either misinformed or messing with you. I drive a manual (always have), and it's perfectly fine to apply a small amount of throttle to maintain constant speed. The only difference between auto and manual is that you don't have to physically move the gears around in an auto. Otherwise, the gas pedal operation is essentially the same No I asked her if it's possible to just keep your foot on the gas a little bit to maintain a constant speed and she said no, it's not possible. Drive it like you drive an automatic, difference is you pick the gears and therefore the RPMs. I'm hoping she is messing with you. It sounds like somebody tried to teach her something legitimate, but the details got lost in translation. When in heavy, stop-and-go traffic, a lot of manual drivers (myself included) will cruise at a steady very slow crawl (like, 3-5mph) while the other cars accelerate and then come to full stops and accelerate and come to a stop again, etc. When doing this, the gap between your car and the car in front of you will expand and contract while your speed remains constant, so at times yes, you *will* be moving towards a stopped car, but the stopped car will either begin moving again, or you'll have to stop for it. If you ever notice, this is how semi trucks usually handle traffic on the freeway (and for good reason too, can you imagine actually starting and stopping every 200 feet in a semi?) Some people claim that [pulse-and-glide](http://www.metrompg.com/posts/pulse-and-glide.htm) method is useful for hypermiling and saving gas. I don't ever pulse and glide on purpose, but the general idea is similar to the freeway driving you're describing, accelerating to higher than your desired cruising speed, and then letting your speed drop (which will use no fuel if your car is in gear and your foot is completely off the throttle). However, neither of those things is exactly the same as what you're describing, which is why I'm guessing she probably heard something about it at some point but just didn't understand what she heard thoroughly. So is she just having fun in our new car and messing with me? Or is she One of them That's not how you do it. At slower speeds you have to work on your clutch and throttle. At highway speeds, you could even be in fourth gear instead of fifth, or put it in neutral. So long as you're traveling at a highway speed, it's not going to putter out. You drive a manual just like any automatic. When you're cruising you keep the RPM at around 2.5K-3K that way the car is able to roll easily. I believe what she was refering to is the car slowing down becuase of the gear it's in. If you are at 5,000 RPM and then let off the gas, the car is going to dramatically slow down. When you're travelling at a constant speed driving a manual is exactly the same as driving an automatic. It's only if you're speeding up or slowing down you'll need to do anything different i.e. change gear."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

How many days per year can I expect to be on training etc... I've also heard that since uni students are non-deployable (?) they're unlikely to take you on. Is that true? I plan on joining full time once I finish my course (4 years) and understand that I'll have to go through training again when joining. I know this isnt what you asked for but if your University has either a Army Officer Training Corps or a University Royal Navy unit, its best to join one of them. Sup, I've just finished my first year at uni. I joined the army reserve back in October when the Otc turned my application down, and have been doing both reserve and uni work since. everyone telling you to go otc unless you specifically want to be an officer. There's far more money in the reserves, in your first year you'll earn- \u00a3300 just for joining \u00a31000 for completing Phase 1 training (which takes three weeks, each day of which you'll be getting paid for so it's more like \u00a31700) \u00a31000 for completing Phase 2 if your chosen role allows in (training takes two weeks so it's more like \u00a31500) That's excluding any weekend work you may pick up and Tuesday evenings. \u00a3350 (roughly) annual bonus that increases every year you remain in the reserve. that's the army reserve. RMR below- I've actually considered moving to the RMR recently. The Phase 1 training takes 18 months and you won't be able to do adventure training until you've completed it, which is what has put me off thus far. I'm also keen to get my training completed as soon as possible to get the cash bonuses I mentored earlier, which I wouldn't get as soon with the RMR. What would you say about balancing work and the army? Especially around exam time. As long as you attend 27 days and one camp a year the rest is entirely voluntary. I just stopped going, it's two hours one night a week during which you don't normally get much done anyway, so I didn't have any reservations about stopping. How come otc turned your application down? 100 applicants for 20 places. Just didn't make the cut I guess The thing is with the otc and UNRU and air Squadron is that they revolve around your university timetable. That being said I'm going to transfer to a regular/group A reserve unit pretty soon as I could do with the extra \u00a3 and enjoy the extra real training instead of the occasional piss about of OTC. Having been an instructor at an OTC and at a normal Reserve unit I'll just reiterate what someone else has said: the OTC works around the academic year. After Easter there's pretty much nothing scheduled in the OTC until after finals to let you focus on your *main reason for going to Uni*: to get a degree. Some Reserve units *may* be accommodating but they don't have to be, and when they're getting pressure from Brigade to get their attendance stats up or passed Phase 1 Training  stats up to keep Army HQ happy they can start to put the pressure on. I had Uni students in my Reserve Company as well and at times it was frustrating because sometimes I needed them to attend stuff and they weren't available, so it works both ways. A Reserve unit has expectations that the OTC doesn't. Focus on your education, use the OTC the way it's intended, don't be drawn by the big bucks in the Reserve. One of my friends went army reserve whilst at uni, and one of the blokes at my OTC went RMR whilst still in uni, so it is doeable. I would recommend a UOTC though. Would it matter that I don't want to be an officer or is it still helpful? I would say its helpful, about four OCdts from our unit passed P coy and transferred to 4 PARA last year as soldiers whilst still at uni. I guess its just uncommon for soldiers to have degrees, most with them go officer You will be taken much more seriously when joining up full time after uni if you have been a reservist rather than OTC. Having said that OTC still teaches you a huge amount, maybe more even, depending on your reserve unit. But it's got a bad Image with the real army. I did my PRMRC and I was in holding troop for about 4 months but ended up not passing. If you want to join full time, just wait and join full time. RMR was the most physically demanding thing I've ever done. It's one mandatory night a week but everyone there said to even have a chance you have to go to one of the phys nights (they also had phys on a saturday morning). Don't just think 'I'm going to join up' , the training is extremely demanding and you should research it well before you try. Not to put you off as I had a great time while there and I do think about giving it another crack sometimes."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

Subreddit: bicycling Hello /r/bicycling. Just joined a few weeks back after purchasing my new ride. I am just curious if the more gearhead oriented in the pack can point me in the right direction of learning to take care of my bicycle after a ride, and maybe some light maintenance instructions. Having invested the money, I really really want to keep her in top shape. Best purchase EVER, I might add. That site belongs to the late, great Sheldon Brown, who will teach you just about everything you could ever want to know about maintaining your bike. I read his site all the time. I was going to post a link to Sheldon Brown, the Guru of all things Bicycle, but I knew if I waited 60 seconds, it would be taken care of for me. I was off by about 15 seconds. I can see I have a lot to learn. Bike on! Buy a bottle of good chain lube (NOT 3-in-one oil or WD-40, get a bicycle-specific chain lube). Get in the good habit of keeping that chain tip-top. If it is making any kind of noise you've waited far too long. the chain and wipe every single last drop that you possible can off of the chain. I dedicate an old T-shirt for this. Anywhere the t-shirt can touch does not need lube and will just attract grit. Tire pressure is a big one, too. Your tires will last longer and you can go faster if you keep them pumped up near the upper limit (especially on tarmac. You can save yourself a lot of money and, more importantly, time if you learn to make the little brake and derailleur adjustments yourself. Make sure to double check your safety items (hell, double check everything and triple check the safety items) like brakes, skewers, tires. Actually, on a bike pretty much everything is a safety item. Ride it all the time. Let the paint get scratched. A good indicator of a well kept bike is one that doesn't make a peep while being ridden. Make sure your wheels stay true and (especially if its a mtn bike) periodically check the spoke tension. If the bike is brand spankin new, check them now so you have a good idea of what a good tension is. The bike shop will help you with this one too. You're about to be even more stoked than you are today The shop I bought it from offers a free first tune up , I noticed some noise coming from one of the derailers, and I just bought it 3 weeks back. I have been doing some 10 milers+ even with the noise, because I didn't want to take it right back. On this advice, I can see I was wrong in my hesitations. things tend to stretch out on new bikes. After a week or two, they need a little adjusting. I'd say you're about right on time for that first tune up. Once your tuned, you don't really need to do a whole lot. Keep your drive-train clean. Make sure your wheels are true. Wipe it down once in a while, and if you ride wet, dry it off. Most of the stuff they do on a tune up, you can do yourself with a few hours of reading/youtubing, and about $30 worth of tools. I would also add that it can be a good idea to frequently clean the entire bike. It keeps your ride looking great and it will help you to find anything that is not quite right. I do my drivetrain maintenance (cleaning and chain oiling) about every 300km And like the previous post said, make sure you keep your tires properly inflated. Check em before every ride. If you want it to stay in tip-top shame, let the pros handle the big stuff. You're goal should be to keep the tires inflated, and keep the bike clean and lubricated. If it stops shifting correctly, or the wheels get to bad out of true, take it to the shop and let them handle it. Don't go out of your way attempting to fix things if you're uncomfortable doing it. Sure there are plenty of guides online on how to do these things, but again let the pros handle it."", ""sub dataset"": ""reddit""}",[],['']

In fact it envisions no positive change of any value - in addition to the failure to address the two major issues of our time mentioned, it plans no steps to tackle widening economic inequality, no steps to loosen the ridiculous budget surplus requirements a previous grand coalition forced into the basic law, no initiatives to combat growing racism in parts of the country.

In 2014, in one of North Rhine-Westphalia\u2019s cities, 8 Muslim Salafists donned orange vests labeled Shariah Police, and went about telling people to stop drinking alcohol, gambling, listening to music, and going to nightclubs. They carried notices in English which read \u201cShariah Controlled Zone\u201d. DW, Germany\u2019s public international broadcaster had an article, on 3/25/16, titled  'Sharia police' who patrolled German city of Wuppertal in orange vests to face trial which said Germany has seen a growing Salafist population in recent years, especially in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), where there are currently an estimated 1,800 followers of the ultra-conservative branch of Islam.

If everything continues the way it was over the past four years the party will be dead by 2022.

Reason - he has no other visible income than salary and that approaches a quarter of million dollars with benefits etc - why would he give up. Currently, there is another fellow - Mr Vince Cable - of the so called Liberal Democrats. He had been thrown out of office. Last election, he was desperate to get back in. I attended a rally where he appeared. And you would think he was just some pensioner on a shoe string budget making end meet. He even lamented his state of affairs. He is elected now - and suddenly, he is like a landed gentry. Something similar at play in Germany. Life in politics is so rewarding - not to mention ego booster - these professional politicians never leave. Ms. Merkel is way past her sale by date. But what would she do?? Having demonized the Russians - unlike one of her predecessors - the Russian will not give her a cushy job. And America - it's a dead end unless she teams up with the 44th - but he is how an ex.

If it can appeal to Turkish-Germans in Essen, it cannot be extreme. What was extreme? Merkel's decision to open the border and suspend all border control in 2015, which led to mass migration of approx 1.5 million mostly young men from another continent away. This lead to Merkel's poor showing in Sept 2017. She should have known that her decision would be disastrous at the voting booth in 2017, especially after terror attacks, mass sexual assaults committed against German women, at least 4 high profile killings of young German women, and higher petty crime rates, but she arrogantly ran again anyway, 12 years in power still not being enough for her. She has surpassed her sell-by date; her inability to form a government 4 months after the election clearly demonstrates that. Hopefully, there will be another election, and the AfD can only gain ground. After 2015, and even 2016 and 2017, Germany needs a timeout regarding immigration; it has enough migrants to last anyone's lifetime. Score: 1 This is eliding some salient fact. Like the regular use of language borrowed from the Nazis by leading AfD members. Like the way the party is constantly moving to the right, pushing out today\u2019s \u201cmoderates\u201d to be replaced by yesterday\u2019s right, who in turn are replaced by people even more right wing. Score: 15 The example of Guido Reil is indicative of the problem that social democratic parties face all over the Western world. Parties built by working-class people to give themselves dignity in the industrial economy of the 20th century have been co-opted by a self-righteous elite that looks down upon its own voter base. While siding with an economic agenda of neoliberal globalization that has diminished workers' economic security, party leaders have embraced identity politics and social Marxism as a means to appeal to various demographic niches. While this may have appealed to some voters, the center-left lost the upper hand on pocketbook issues that have previously been a strength throughout the electorate, and voters who would support Mr. Reil have looked elsewhere for their political home. The most recent wave of migration, wherein European leaders like Merkel welcomed large numbers immigrants from the most unstable region of the world without any kind of vetting or control, was the straw that broke the camel's back. Both mainstream parties saw large-scale defections to the AfD last year, sending a very clear message that voters want enforced limits on immigration and better public security in areas where admitted migrants live. If Germany's leaders do not heed the will of voters, they will continue to face defections and electoral losses."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

This project of saving a few buildings is not in any way similar to wanting to hold on to one's language or \u201cnative\u201d culture. The Chinese speak various dialects of Cantonese and Mandarin; the buildings built in the period in question were designed by Westerners, built by local workers. Those working on this project are not looking to preserve native Chinese culture. They're looking to preserve certain pieces of architecture which were designed by Westerners, mostly *for* Westerners or wealthy Hong Kong Chinese. If anything, they are attempting to do exactly the *opposite* of what you're suggesting. The buildings some in Hong Kong wish to preserve actually represent the colonial period: rulership of the British whites over Chinese. Except *those* whites (the British) were wise enough to never threaten or actually require the Chinese to speak English. Instead, they built English speaking schools and invited elite Chinese who wanted their children to be multilingual to attend.

The Hong Kong economy is driven solely by real estate, controlled by a handful of mega-developers who consolidated their stranglehold over the government in the post-handover world. These family-owned enterprises took advantage of the sudden emasculation of the Hong Kong government once Britain exited, and are now firmly in league with the mainland authorities. \u201cLocalists\u201d along with champions of Hong Kong political autonomy are essentially resisting developer greed. They don\u2019t necessarily worship these old structures except as a symbol of an era in which the Hong Kong people enjoyed certain freedoms and civil rights that have since been stripped from them.

I don\u2019t think someone living in Salem can appreciate that barely 60 years ago, a hell of a lot of modern megatropolis HK was very much little more than a fishing village or town, with much of the vast sprawl of modern HK now having obliterated fields and farms to the horizon that older HKers can still recall.

Star Ferry is a symbol of old Hong Kong, representative of the colonial period than truly old Hong Kong, much of which was still standing when I lived there (and some of it still stands, specifically certain Victorian-era houses on the Peak. The Star Ferry far is more important as a symbol than as a method of transportation, but the last time I was there, I almost cried in gratitude it was not gone in the Chinese rush toward progress.

As a young person, I was often puzzled by the numerous references I would hear from Indian friends of Auntie or Grandmother until I understood their culture (mostly Sioux where I lived) included such close, non-blood relations in the matriarchal line. But at the time of my youth, at least where I lived, so many young people still suffered from enormous depression and loss; too many of them had not yet developed the strong sense of purpose seen here, and so sadly understandable.

Chiefly, the egregious error was in determining by an automatic presumption guided by U.S. policy predating WW II that the liberation forces that defeated the French were an enemy.

In this connection, it is noteworthy that, whereas Professor Goscha implies the United States' complicity in Diem's overthrow and death, Mr. McNamara gave the sense of assiduously eliding that key point in the movie. Of course, for present-day purposes, all that this article recounts stands as vital wisdom, when it comes to the unforeseen consequences of ill-advised interventions and manipulations -- whether undertaken with respect to, say, the affairs of other countries; the construction of public opinion; or the truth, itself.

Additionally they would liaise with properly funded community treatment centers that would be open after 4 pm and during the weekends when they are most needed. They would funded mainly by taxes on recreational drugs that in proportion to their associated harms. Thus cannabis would be taxed more lightly that alcohol.

This abruptly reversed after the death of Freddie Gray and the subsequent riots. The number of police per capita was cut and they stepped back due to the outcry and the time. This is believed to explain in large part why crime has shot up. A freedom of information request by the Baltimore Sun helped to demonstrate that the police officers were factually innocent in the Freddie Gray case. While in New York City, shootings by police dropped from 314 in 1971 (93 of them fatal) to 23 in 2015 (with eight of them fatal). Reality is complicated.

And crime was very high. Bryant Park was needle park, and police stood at the top of the subway entrance stairs, almost never going downstairs to patrol the platforms. Sure there are many complex factors contributing to crime rates, and variations in the kinds of crimes that are most prevalent. And law enforcement has many better tools nowadays for crime prevention, and more rapid intervention. There is always a need for more, and even constant, training in the use of deadly force, and community relations. But reducing police force numbers now, in the face of a massive opioid epidemic, when we know that the largest percentage of crime is associated with drug dependence; and when we know that police are using Narcon daily to save lives, would have a terrible impact on community safety. Score: 1 The high crime rates in the 1970's correlated with the reduction of the police force due to NYC's financial crisis. This was devastating to NYC and many thought it would not recover. It is true that many community services can help reduce crime but cutting back on the cities police force is a recipe for a rise in crime. Police departments priorities have had to pivot over the years Look how much anti-terrorism has become a job for police when once it was not even on the radar.

(1) I understand that some topics are difficult to talk about and that some art is can cause anger but I think that it is irrational to make topics off-limits because people don't agree with it. I personally believe that artists should be able to write about anything they want, drive to the studio, then turn those words into beautiful music. Music is an art and in art there are no limits so honestly whatever they feel is relevant to write about, they should have the freedom to do so. Regardless of peoples personal opinions artist should be comfortable to talk about what they want to talk about. We all encounter art we don't like, that upsets and infuriates us. A few examples would be, hate crimes against all races, racism in america, people killing other people. Its just the sad truth that a lot of people hate to hear. Music is a powerful-subject that can really impact a person. nothing should be in limited to artist. they should havethe freedom to do what they pleased. I believe there isn't a problem when a white artist draws a topic that is related to discrimination against the Blacks. This artist may want to show that killing black people is wrong. It doesn't matter if she's white or black. I don't think that any topic is out of bounds to an artist. That is the idea of an artist, isn't it? To talk about subjects that they think should be talked about, or that they feel motivated to bring attention to. I don't think it is right to throw blame and anger towards one group because they are creating art about a different group. I understand why there is anger, but demanding that a work be destroyed is just absurd to me. Could the artist have done something differently? Possibly, but demanding empathy and understanding from a group different than your own, and then saying their act of trying to do so is inappropriate just doesn't make sense. I don't think any one group owns history. History is a human experience. People as a collective own the histories that shaped the world they live in. That is the point of the exhibition. The exhibition description on the Whitney site says, Throughout the exhibition, artists challenge us to consider how these realities affect our senses of self and community. how the painting makes us feel about ourselves and our communities, because I am sure that everyone could say that there is room for improvement when it comes to both. The question of whether or not any group owns a portion of history is not the issue. It is about how that imagery is used, if it is used intelligently, and that it mimics an aspect of white racism: the historic practice of whites displaying the mutilated corpses of black people.

Of course it had to rain, Chicago,unlike L.A. actually has 4 seasons, and it is springtime there. The only thing that made this work was the acquisition of both Theo and Joe Maddon. Decades of frustration because of bad managing or bad GMing. You focus on the player's character as well as his skills. Now, let's get that bullpen fixed because I think one or two of those guys have outlived their usefulness.

She followed this team and had her favorites (Russell and Rizzo) with the same passion as those of her childhood. We shared the 7th game of the World Series together. Something that will always put a smile on my face. She passed away last week. At nearly 101 she just wanted to know if she could get the Cubs games in the hospital.

Then came Billy Williams and Ron Santo and unforgettable Ernie Banks, Sandberg and the disappointment of 1969 followed by the repeat of 1985. We loved and suffered through two thirds of our lives, even as I left Chicago. We knew that the day would come, as it did.

Although I generally agree that too much media coverage of terrorism feeds it, the courage of the photographer cannot be ignored. Such extraordinary professionalism should be rewarded. On a lighter note, the Usain Bolt photo was robbed! And the panda photo is pretty great too. I'm regularly stunned by the quality of some photo in the Times.

Four out of 11 candidates for the President are running neck to neck according to the latest poll. Such popular polls were deceptive both on the ballot for the Brexit and the election of Donald Trump. The final outcome in Britain and the USA negated political Pundits and poll prediction.

Many french people see all the candidates as just awful and refuse to condone even one. The problem with the vote blanc is that it could allow for the worst of the worst (Le Pen) to win. Many of the protest voters will vote for whoever is not Le Pen in the second round. So they say that Le Pen will not win the second round. A vote of support for M.

It is still very backwards thinking in China along this realm. The second big issue is that these 'semi-adults' are never really independent from their parents--ever. They can't or won't stand up to their parents and as the article states, that's not really being an adult. But that's how they were brought up--both by their parents and by the country.

We are both amazed at the social dynamic in the relations between university age boys and girls. They live in two different worlds. The article talks about the dating and marriage process but the whole male/female dynamic in China is unequal, and it has gotten worst in the last 30 years as China is reverting to a Confucian society. The government has facilitated this process in order to create a more obedient society. Woman are allowed to contribute in society, in fact they are encouraged to work, but when it comes to taking roles where they will lead a group of individuals that might include men, that is rare. Also, the significance of giving birth and raising the child is growing, putting pressure on the woman to stay at home. To compound it all, a husband who can afford to have his wife stay at home will have greater \u201cface\u201d than one whose wife works. This will compound the shortage of workers that the one-child policy has already started causing. Score: 6 Those kind of TV shows are dime-a-dozen on Chinese TV. And the danger is reading too much into it. Of course there are still Chinese parents want to take over to arrange their kids' marriage, but I feel it is largely limited to a small fraction of city folks. And even in those arranged affairs, the kids involved still hold veto power. But among young city residents that come from countryside, there are much less or no parental involvement. So the Chinese society has changed a lot in the last 20 years, like everything else in China. Score: 4 The young people still make the final call, no matter the parents' opinions. And the parents know this. Hence, it's not really an arranged marriage. Also, many older women (35+) were rejected by parents of the potential boyfriend because the son himself is around 22 or 23 years old. The parents are there to avoid awkward confrontations in future meetings, and awkward conversations about financial capabilities. Also, there's wrong with being proud of your daughter having high standards for her male partner. This is reflected in the mean marriage age increasing every year, because women are chasing their careers. The reason why the age is still lower than the European Union is because girls in rural China still marry young, bringing down the country's average. Score: 7 Thirty-five years ago, I worked with a recently married 24 y.o. a woman from India who seemed very happy amid a throng of fuzzy little dolls that festooned her cubicle. I was curious about her happy experience and the dating differences that led to early commitment & marriage. I learned hers was an arranged marriage that began after college graduation. Her dating began with a newspaper announcement from her family that they were now considering potential suitors for their daughter -- doctors (MDs) only. From 200 or so responses, her family narrowed the selection to about a dozen (family names indicate social status) who they interviewed From them, the family selected three for her to meet and choose from. I marveled at the efficiency of the stress-free dating -- and her happiness. A year later, I met someone while working elsewhere who reminded me of that woman; this woman was dour, unsmiling. I was stunned to learn they were the same. Something had gone wrong and I could only guess. All of a sudden, US dating practices seemed to make more sense. We like to say that behind every successful man is a successful woman -- and a surprised mother-in-law.

Score: 4 In a country with a 50% divorce rate, a Chinese famiy decision could not bring a much higher level of bad marriages. Though I doubt this tradition will last many more generations in the Eastern nations, we in the USA might show some respect for the tradition as it now is.

Should've voted for President Hillary Clinton and the Democrats to take us forward into the 21st century and the civilized world but instead we are headed into 1930s Germany or the first century. More government more regulations not less more socialism! At the time President Roosevelt was elected, our country was in very bad shape after entering into a prolonged and continued economic depression. Trump inheritied a nation in tact, on the upswing economically, garnering high esteem from its global partners. Through cautious diplomacy we had engaged in meaningful dialogue with our global partners. In two weeks Trump has managed to damage our relationship with one of our strongest allies and threaten the economic stability and growth by banning its own people - U.S. legal permanent residents. Trump is no FDR. FDR took well thought out and planned actions which were necessary to save the banking industry at the time. He had years of experience in government and surrounded himself with seasoned public servants. Trump is a trumped up businessman who is quickly becoming the puppet of Steve Bannon and his ilk. As we saw throughout the campaign, here is another attempt to rationalize Trump's behavior by treating him as a normal politician and shoe-horning him into a historical context, as if to say See, they all do it True objectivity would be to scream from the roof tops how uniquely delusional, bad and dangerous this man is. Score: 7 Roosevelt inherited a country with massive unemployment, homelessness, joblessness, a failing banking and stock market and collapsing international trade as well as the threat posed by the emerging Nazi Party and Fascist ideology. All of this, in a country with virtually no social safety net. Still he managed to give a hopeful inaugural address and to rally most of the country behind him. The Donald inherited a country facing no existential threat, with a strong economic base, where employment has risen for the last 7 years. Both corporate profits and executive compensation have risen to astronomical hights and recently wages have started to climb as well. Yet his inaugural address could be read as everything is terrible, be afraid, be very afraid , only I can save you. Where Roosevelt faced soup lines and people selling apples in the inner cities- Donald imagines lurking drug lords and gang members ready to shoot anyone, they see. He believes contrary to all evidence that crime and poverty are rising; that American workers are suffering and being deprived of jobs by heartless bureaucrats not technology but with all these horrible problems he choses to spend his time tweeting about the size of his inaugural crowds, imaginary illegal aliens voting for his opponent, his distrust of American intelligence, and Arnold Schwartzenagers terrible ratings.

According to Dr. David Perlmutter, 60% of Alzheimer's patients don't carry APOE-epsilon 4 gene. Dr. Russell Jaffe, an expert in methylation and detoxification, cautions that glutathione is only produced in the cells when cells and mitochondria are healthy, with lots of minerals in the cells, slightly alkali state, and are filled with vitamin C. However, most of the people are suffering from metabolic acidosis due to toxins such as dangerous minerals, metals and chemicals. Without excreting these toxins, glutathione is always used up (1) to trap free radicals and (2) to detoxify toxins to transport to liver. The problem of the glutathione treatment of Alzheimer's patients is that glutathione can't reach brain due to blood/brain barrier. Glutathione have to be produced in the brain cells.

Though I have not kept in close touch with the literature, over the last 15 years, the thread running through most of what has shown any glimmer of promise has been maximizing cerebrovascular blood flow and oxygenation, whether by exercise regimens, dietary recommendations, or pharmacological interventions. So this report does not surprise me. But such interventions do not do all the heavy lifting. Much of later life cognitive decline is a product of deliberate habits of mind, shaped by the person's physiological circumstances. Good mental habits wane when they get too effortful to maintain. Optimum habits do not emerge out of thin air when good brain conditions are created. Those habits of mind have to be maintained, or trained, sometimes swimming against the current.

Even the best of them are just people, like anyone else. They suck up media attention that would better be served searching and profiling the un-glamorous who, if made known, could inspire others to a life of character and purpose. I do, though, understand the temptation for public interest groups, always short of money and needing to find ways to get their message out, putting their qualms aside if one of them is interested in helping out.

At the same time, so many people have different interpretations of what feminst means, who gets to claim the mantel of defining the term?

Keywords: Baseball; Equal Educational Opportunities Snippet: What needs changing, and why, in professional sports? Score: 0 Do you think your favorite sport is the same as 30 years ago? Sports are evolving all the time, and I don't think that you can change your sport except changing playing time and some little rules . To Modify big things would be changing the core of sports. i disagree with this. i would change some things about baseball but its so dumb how they say oh putting on gloves just take too much time. but yes the break are very long but i kinda agree then disagree of for doing something with the inngs because yea the game does take too long and most people would stop watching ny the 7 inns but i think it doesnt matter because lets see you go to a baseball game. you spent good money for a good but if the game end too early whats the whole point because for me i think the game time is just fine. but the main problem is the starting time and how much games they play in a week. but now back to the breaks or commercials and yeas i do agree with that it is too long and yes like in the world series it took so long like 8min just wating. another thing i disgree with is there should still be 4 balls and 3 strikes. i dont think every foul ball should count as a strike . lets say your 3-2 and you keep hiting the ball but its fouls i thinks its fine because then everyone can have even more chances to be in bat or hit the ball. but overall base should just change some things not all and just stay with 9 no 7. I have to agree on the fact that baseball games are long, too long for many to sir down and try and stay focused on the game for the entirety of it. The suggestion to make the commercial breaks shorter is definitely a great option as there tends to be various commercial breaks between baseball games and other sports as well. I agree that Baseball games are long and last about 3 hours because of the innings, ads, and too many active players. Shorten ads is a good idea because the ads actually really get annoying and they are long. This will make the baseball games finish quicker. I also agree with having less active players per games because this will change the game to go quicker because the coach doesn\u2019t have to worry too much about making sure every player plays. I also agree with shorten the game from nine innings to seven innings. I disagree with counting a foul ball with as a strike out because that would give the batter less chances to actually hit the ball to a home run. I agree that we should change some things about baseball. Baseball games are too long to watch and should have the commercials shorter. The only thing that makes baseball games longer are the commercials. They should cut the commercials by a lot of time because the commercials can be up to 2 minutes. Baseball shouldn't have overtimes. If the game is tied then it's tied. I believe that if they do have overtime, the most time given is an inning. 9 innings is a lot already, and when it goes overtime it's even more innings. I would have to agree that Baseball games are too long, but only when you watch them at home. As shown in the Article I am not the only one who thinks that the commercials are way too long especially during important games because while I'm getting notifications on ESPN that Dodgers are scoring, I'm still watching a Budweiser commercial and as I think about it now I can see why people find baseball so boring because as soon as an inning finishes the throw like 3 minute commercials that can really be frustrating. Which is why I think they should cut out 30 seconds of commercials like the artilce stated. If I could change my favorite sport I\u2019d change basketball. If I could change basketball I would make the quarters longer in the game. is not enough time in one basketball game. 4 quarters isn\u2019t enough. I think that goes to all sports actually though. Seem like the game doesn\u2019t end fairly because it\u2019s not enough time also the referees don\u2019t actually call plays in time nor at the right time. 5 quarters seem like the right amount because its longer and athletes can demonstrate to their best ability. People think that baseball is too long. A lot of people think that the league should make games shorter because according to the article Baseball\u2019s Too Slow. Here\u2019s How You Fix It, it says, \u201cThe average game last season took three hours. This shows how long t baseball games have been in the last season. Three hours is a really long time if you ask me. The article also provided ways to fix these really long games. One way the article mentions to make baseball games shorter is to shorten all the ads. In the same article it says, \u201cWant the game to move more quickly? This just means that the one showing the games on TV should just make commercial breaks shorter. This can be helpful because some people think that the commercial breaks are too long. If they shorten the all of the commercial breaks then this could make games go buy quicker on TV. Another way of making baseball games shorter is to not have so many innings. Baseball games always have 9 innings. They could have even more if the two teams go into overtime. In the article it talks about how if the league cut games down to only seven innings then they could save a lot of time. This means that instead of having all nine innings they should only have seven. Well this isn\u2019t just for my favorite sport it goes for all sports I think they should start back letting the 5 Star above all other top athlete\u2019s go straight to the pro\u2019s from High School. I know they stopped that so athletes could get their education but not everybody is that good so it\u2019s not like the High School athletes in the nation will be drafted out of high school but only a small percent. I didn\u2019t agree with any suggestions about changing baseball. I think the games are long enough if they have them any longer than people would lose interest. If I could change anything about any sport I would make it where each team would have to have a certain amount of girls and boys. If I could change anything about school sports it would be the seasons. I would make some last longer than others. For example, I really like basketball so I would make the season just a little bit longer and I would make soccer shorter because I don\u2019t really like it. I don't think you should change the rules in any sport because it will change the game as a whole. My go-to sport is volleyball and if i had to change a rule in the game it would be the only touch the ball once rule. I think this could make the game more fun and more exciting to watch, but i don't think you should change the rules in any sport because it will change the game as a whole. Baseball is too slow. My favorite sport is softball i tend to think that baseball does take a long time. They should consider entertaining the crowd more, so they can't get bored. Reducing ads would be a great idea, because no one came to see some ads that they might not even remember. The games can take as long as WW1. Baseball is too slow. Score: 1 Some of things that can help baseball games move quicker is cutting the commercial breaks by 30 seconds each. If they want to get more fans then put the games on fox sports then on the hard to find fox sports 1, make the World Series an appointment viewing and if you want to appeal young fans then let them watch a game before bedtime. The last time I went to a baseball game I didn\u2019t get home till 12 at night. The game went to 12 innings and I fell asleep through the 7-10 innings. I was so tired when I got home I didn\u2019t wake up till 11 the next day and it was a school day. Although I didn\u2019t get I trouble for sleeping in I still was mad at myself for not getting up on time. I haven\u2019t been to a baseball game since. I agree with this article that baseball games need to end quicker than they do now. Score: 0 My favorite sport is motocross. In my opinion it is the most physically-demanding sport that I have experienced throughout my childhood. Motocross requires you to workout on a regular basis, eat healthy as much as you can, and to have plenty of time to practice at the track. Professional sports bother me because they have way to many restrictions and with motocross, it is a one man team which allows you to race and train as much as you want and when you want. My favorite sport is football, and in my opinion, I think there\u2019s too many penalties, and the league is too strict. All the penalties make the game soft. Like for example, Unnecessary Roughness. Football is meant to be played rough. Also, penalties on the defense make the offense very overpowered, like roughing the passer and pass interference. Players should be allowed to fight, like in hockey. Also, players are only allowed to wear custom cleats one week in the NFL. For example, Odell Beckham Jr. was fined a whopping $18,000 dollars for wearing custom cleats that honored the late Craig Sager. Odell said \u201cI got fined 18k for Craig Sager cleats that were auction off the cleats to the highest bidder and donating the proceeds to his cancer research.\u201d Players also constantly get fined for their celebrations. People are starting to call the NFL the \u201cNo Fun League.\u201d The athletic wide receiver with a determined attitude leaped over the cornerback and snagged the ball out of the air. Then, was fined for dancing in the end zone. Players should also be allowed to put nicknames on the back of their jerseys. My favorite sport is football and I do think some aspects of the game has to be changed. I think one major thing that needs to happen is roughing the passer is called way to much the defense will touch the quarterbacks arm with there hand after he throws it and he will get a penalty that gives the offense 10-yards. Also a lot of players are getting less and less aggressive they're like girls. These are some problems with the NFL i'm sure there are billions of different problems out there but these are a few that I think is most important. My favorite sport is soccer. If I was going to change it in any way it would be your allowed to use your hands once a game for 5 seconds. It would kind of be unfair but you can strip the ball from people but that is your hands for the game, It can make game faster pace, and if you have a person that can throw far you can have him make crazy throws to people. Like you can make 20-yard throws to the middle of the field. This is why my favorite sport is soccer. well my favorite sport is baseball and it will probably always will be. if i was to change my sport it would have to be badminton because you can hit the bride and it will barely go any where that's my 2nd favorite sport I don't think changing sports is the right idea, especially when your changing the whole sport, Thats like changing a state to a completely different state. You might as well make a new sport. I am a skateboarder and skateboarding changes a lot but i just skate the way i want to, and i just skate every day, all day. I wake up, get dressed, eat, and then skate all day I think changing a sport isn't the right thing to do if you wanted to change the sport i think you should make a whole new sport, but if i were to change any sport it would be soccer. When i was about 10-years-old i started to realize the refs started getting really bad and i thought that if we could make any new rule it would be to have many cameras all over the field to assist the refs with some of the calls they make. I think that some refs make calls just to make them and if we had cameras to assist them calls to them can come so much easier. Easier than eating food.

They're very good because they don't have any head cases, the coach is cool and smart, and the GM stays out of the way. But they do have shortcomings. They need better interior defense and rebounding. Plus, they need someone other than Thomas who can get his own shot consistently. Take Thomas off the floor, and the quality of play goes down.

Durant, Currry, and company, and Leonard, Aldridge and company, in particular, are 10 games ahead of Boston. Stevens has a history of overachieving going back to Butler. And he has a history of creating locker room harmony that has taken his teams far. But I think it was a mistake, when DeMarcus Cousins was on the market, for the Celtics to avoid him because of his reputation as difficult. It has taken a little time, but Cousins and Davis are meshing in New Orleans, and both are playing well. Cousins is a top 10 NBA player according to many. When I think of him, I think of Randy Moss -- a superstar with attitude issues. Belichick did not hesitate to acquire Moss, who was the team's top receiver three years running I fear that the Celtics and Stevens are too focused on harmony at the expense of talent. Overachievement is great, but turning down a top 10 talent because of fragile locker room chemistry tends to assure that you will alawys have to overachieve in order to win, They will (would) be underdogs against the Warriors, but I was at the game this season in Oakland when the Celts beat them. Granted, Durrant wasn't playing, but Steph and Klay do not like playing against Bradley and Smart! see today's higlights on ESPN featuring five steps without a dribble,,,,uncalled. So not a fan for a very long time (Eddie Donovan's days). But was mildly curious when Jackson hired: would he have the vision and guts to get rid of Carmelo, and take the only path, arduous and unpredictable as it might be, to real competitiveness for the Knickerbockers?

Triangulate somewhere else. Were the Knicks the Celtics, instead of arresting their ex-giving 100% every day, players like Oakley, they would be making them an integral part of mapping out a rebuilding strategy. If you are a Knick fan, this is a truly depressing article. Like the Knicks, the Nets thought building a team the proper way through the draft would take too much time and instead gave a way a bevy of high draft choices for washed up stars.

No recent NBA team has gotten a whiff of even the FInals without 2 legitimate All-Stars. It would be a major accomplishment if the Celtics got past Lebron James and the Cavs and faced the Warriors or Spurs in the Finals.

Parents should be more chill and shouldn't be so aggressive and pressure their kids. I think there are more ways that parents pressure their kids. kids shouldn't be told that guns are ok to carry around not even for self defense only soldiers need that kind if right If anything, more children should be told to carry around guns both concealed and unconcealed. By doing this we are teaching children to exercise their second amendment rights. This also will reduce the violence believe it or not.

Tonight I dined at Saint Peter for the first time. it truely is the most extraordinary fish restaurant in Australia. Comparing it to leading seafood restaurants like Sea Fire Grill in midtown is hard - it is apples vs oranges. Saint Peter succeeds in the the difficult task of making something which outwardly appears simple and casual, but at the same time is executed with extremely fine cooking skills. Looking at the small open kitchen the grill was not industrial - but two small japanese habachi charcoal bbqs. No wonder the fish had that sutle smokey flavour. King George Whiting, pin boned and dusted in fine crumbs and simply pan fried like a minute steak was one of the best fish dishes I have ever tried. It out shone the roast John Dory tranche my wife had, while still beautiful, just did not reach the dizzy hights of abject simplicity. The fact that King George whiting is only found in waters off Adealde, half way across Australia showed the lengths the young chef has gone to source top produce. If he had access to some great north atlantic produce like Maine lobster - which we have no real comparable crayfish here, I am sure it would also be extraordinary. Booking online for two sittings. Price A$110/USD$78 per head for three courses without wine. and I would be happy to pay for it again and again and again. I enjoy seafood whenever in Sydney. That said, fish from the cold Atlantic is the best. Cod being a favorite. And I prefer our briny New England oysters to the creamier Australian ones. Score: 2 The Atlantic produces nothing like Barramundi or Jew Fish, Hawkesbury is famous for its oysters and a local crab, the Balmain Bug has more flavour that anything from the Atlantic--as do local crabs and lobsters.

I don't quite agree with the sweeping statement that American seafood restaurants have fallen into the New England crab shack category because you don't see many New England crab shacks. Clam shacks perhaps but let's get the geography straight and keep the crabs south of the Mason Dixon line and the quahogs to the north. Clam bars, oyster bars have been stables throughout the U.S. Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and West Coast for more than a century. Maybe there are a new breed of commercially inspired crab/oyster themed restaurants around the country but they are outnumbered by the old guard, like the Acme in New Orleans or Swan Oyster Depot in San Francisco. You can find good fish, cooked simply or prepared in a pan, basted with good butter, a splash of lemon and cut parsley. in many American restaurants. A great piece of fried fish with good fries and fresh slaw is another masterpiece when properly prepared. I certainly appreciate the inventiveness of the seafood chef's down under and applaud their ability to bring new ideas and techniques to the table but I must defend a lot of the good seafood restaurants in this country, many of which are never mentioned in print because they are but a small blip on the foodie radar and known mostly to locals alone.

That way we would get much better interviews. It's the same thing when people try to interview Klay Thompson or a number of others who really just want to play basketball and are less interested in speaking to the media.

Obnoxious hogs the ball, the spotlight, sucks up all the oxygen and asphyxiates brothers as anonymous afterthoughts. Great players -- Durant, Harden, Ibaka -- can't get far enough away fast enough.

It was painful to see the spirit crushed out of him, game by game, team by team. Not everyone, no matter how brilliant a tactician, is meant to actually be a coach or manager, of soccer or any team sport that involves real people. Balotelli bumped up against plenty of pig headed, blinders on commandants like that. Nice is lucky to have found a mix which allows quality managers/coaches to bring out the very best in their team and its players. Wishing you both a magical conclusion to the year. Score: 1 Shelve the comparisons to Leicester. Nobody on Leicester had the high profile that either Balotelli or Ben Arfa had before Leicester won the Prem. It didn't go that well in the Europa League, but perhaps them being free of European nights, and P$G and Money-go still occupied, at least for now, might make a difference. Score: 2 Balotelli has always been enigmatic - talented, sure, but also lazy and too full of himself. I mean this is a man who set off fireworks in his room; threw money around (literally) at some event. Clearly someone without his feet on the ground . however, I have also seen him score some brilliant goals, stick it to the racists taunting him, and perform at an elite level. This is the Balotelli the football world wants to see succeed - or at least I do . Score: 4 The beautiful game helps to heal a beautiful city and the beautiful city helps to heal Balotelli. Symmetry.

I commend the New York Times for their constant and in-depth coverage in this area and confusing my education in this area. What lovely piece! Vive Nice! Score: 0 One of the most overrated players ever. When he's playing against a proper defence he goes missing. Now he's in France where my grandma can score he's doing reasonably well? I'm interested in the football scene on the Continent. Score: 10 I am glad Balotelli has changed, I mean, as a player. Every time I saw him play, he was an indolent player, just hanging around for a chance to shoot at goal. Undeniably, he can kick the ball with power and when he is on, he is impressive. However, I never saw a player lose the ball with so much frequency: he is (was) totally unable to defend the ball and that takes chances away from his team. With or without Balotelli, I hope that Nice wins."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

Score: 0.0 I feel that the information in this article is really lacking. You show charts with no key and none of them really say where the jobs are created. Not only that, the article doesn't expand on how to make the solar industry more economically efficient or how it is economically efficient at all. Solar energy doesn't take up as many jobs as the coal industry does because most of the jobs in the solar power are automated by machines along with the fact that we depend on coal for the majority of our energy. In the United States coal makes up about 40% of all energy. Coal is also cheaper because it gets imported from third world countries so the only thing that costs a lot of money is transportation. With solar energy the cost of labor and upkeep is a lot higher due to most solar panels being built by engineers in first world countries. So even though there is a rise in renewable energy I highly doubt that it will become the most cost efficient source of energy until it becomes cheaper to manufacture. If we can make it so everyone can buy solar panels that last 10 years and power a whole household at the cost of $2000-$3000 then it would be cost efficient to invest in making your house more environmentally friendly. But as of right now even if you got the energy not from personal solar panels but from farms, you would still be paying more for energy then with coal, natural gas, or oil.

This is very interesting and necessary education for NYT readers! The editors of NYT should be asking you to write an article or be interviewed by a reporter with credentials. Well Caroline Crosson Gilpin, does not look as though there is much interest in today's energy jobs. My comment was in print 7 h ago (14:00 CET) and not another voice has been heard from -21:00 h here on the other side of the Atlantic. But since I was focused on the diagram in my first reading I will offer answers to your question at the end of the article. Given Swedish experience, where hypermodern solid-waste incineration heat whole cities, here is my first answer. Replace every coal-fired plant with solid-waste incineration. This will require waste collection at the efficiency level standard here. If you were to develop district heating then there would be jobs in every city to lay all those pipelines. I do not expect that to happen in the US. Also standard in Sweden are various forms of heat-pump technology. Ground-source geothermal (GSG HP) is the best of all renewable technologies present in the form of 400,000 systems here - in a country where cities are heated by solid-waste. Take a look in Vermont, lots of old-fashioned oiil burners there. If each were to be replaced by ground-source there would be lots of work for drillers, installers, and sales people. But instead just visit Bernie Sanders' VT and learn what it took to build systems at Champlain and Saint Michaels Colleges - for a start. And then right under the nose of the NYT - Cornell Tech GSG HP lots of workers there. Wake up NYT.

Missing: in the United States Misleading: The three fossil fuels are used to heat as well as to produce electricity. A separate diagram showing clearly what other and bioenergy include. So that is the dismaying picture for 2016 USA. What is needed to awaken readers is a one similar diagram for, may I suggest, either one Nordic country or for all Nordic countries together. In such a diagram the fossil fuel sector would shrink drastically, and bioenergy and other would expand dramatically, filling the fossil fuel space. I use my Swedish city to illustrate. Link\u00f6ping is heated by the fj\u00e4rrv\u00e4rme system - hypermodern incineration of solid waste to heat water to 100 C which is then sent to take care of space heating in the entire city and also meet hot water needs. Much of the heating out in the countryside beyond the reach of the Fj\u00e4rrv\u00e4rme system is accomplished by ground-source geothermal heat pump systems (400,000 units in all of Sweden) and by air-air and air-water heat pump systems. Direct electrical heating is still present, a hold over from the days when nuclear was to provide free electricity. And food and human wastes become bioenergy - biogas.

The difficulty, as always, was in finding the arrangement. To begin with, the same problem that occurred the last Thursday occurred again this Thursday. The new puzzles were not there. Therefore I am grateful to whomever it was who last week pointed out that you can get the new puzzles to come up by bringing up the previous week\u2019s puzzles, and then changing the date in the Web address. Anyway, I was very happy to see Marching Bands again. And doesn\u2019t the \u201cfree space\u201d in the center remind you of Bingo? Something we only see occasionally is the same clue appearing more than once, in this case for ADORN and GARNISH. Another interesting feature was the use of very uncommon forms of common words (SEISM and CENCED). TROPPO standing by itself is also in that category. DOG-AND-PONY-SHOW was a new one for me. I wonder if it is as obsolescent as STRAW mattresses are, or if I simply had never heard of it. Score: 2.0 GREEN ACRES was what immediately occurred to me. In my opinion, that was a poor clue for MISTER ED. They were supposed to be living in some town, not in the country. Wilbur would ride Mr. Ed in the park. In rural areas, they don't need public parks. Score: 0.0 DOG-AND-PONY-SHOW was an early answer for me. I was familiar with the phrase before, but even if I hadn't been, I believe it was a Jeopardy! final answer this past week I had the same issues with uncommon words/spellings as others, but there were enough gimmes to fill in the few things I really didn't know (like TALESE). While my music background was help in this puzzle, I got thrown for a loop with the opposites of jas for a minute.

Score: 0.0 Bad calls will happen, this game is very hard to officiate perfectly. The referee probably did not willfully favor Real Madrid. There is an unconscious bias in favor of the stronger team or the receiving team, often in favor of Bayern Munich. For those who blame Viktor Kassai for the bad offside calls, it is not him who signals the offsides but the line referees. Now consider how they need to do this: they have to move as fast as the last defender, while keeping themselves in line, and at the same time keep an eye on the offense players (often more than one) while keeping an eye on the ball is so that they may judge at the exact moment when the ball is kicked whether the offense was in off-side position. Sometimes the kick happpens in their back just as they are running to keep in line. So why not just admit that the job is intrinsically difficult and tolerate imperfection ? Players are allowed mistakes, why not referees ? Quite a few unbiased commenters I know mentioned that Vidal indeed did not deserve a second yellow card, but actually had deserved the red card for his first foul. Keep the video away from soccer (other than goal calls) lest it affects one of its critical features : uninterrupted play which requires an excellent physical condition. It is not referees which are the cause of the frustration, it is the financial consequences. There is just too much money involved for the clubs. Score: 2.0 Referees are routinely overwhelmed by the game. Howard Webb was regarded as the best in the world until he completely ruined the 2010 World Cup Final. The decision to send off a player or not is where referees crack most often. In 2010, Holland adopted a strategy betting that Webb would resist ruining the final by sending off a player, particularly in the first half. Exhibit A, Nigel de Jong cleating Xabi Alonso squarely in the chest. It is a red card as clearly as the rules of the game can express. Excessive force, recklessly dangerous, with no regard for the safety of an opponent. Webb's cowardly yellow was permission for anarchy to ensue, and it did. Kassai was running toward Casemiro with his hand reaching for his pocket after his cynical foul on Robben, whose own diving history might have colored Kassai's decisionmaking. Yet Kassai got his hand away from his pocket when he realized he had already booked Casemiro. Yes, Vidal could have walked earlier himself, but 10 v. 10 would have been a more just way to play out the match than casiering Vidal for a totally clean tackle, and not sanctioning Casemiro. There was no excuse for the same linesman to blow two offside calls, both in Real's favor. Marcelo clearly played Lewandowski onside, and there is no excuse for blowing the tie winning offside goal by Ronaldo. Score: 0.0 I did not see the game, but the complaint was that two goals resulted from uncalled players being off-side. I always thought that the assistant referees on the sidelines are supposed to be in position to and make off-side calls. It is not the chief referee who can, given his position on the field. So you should not blame the chief referee for those calls (or no-calls). The red card is another story and I will not comment as I did not see the game. Score: 1.0 why hasn't soccer allowed video reviews? This game is one of countless examples where soccer needs video reviews. You can't put that much pressure on the officials. They are in a hostlie invorment and have to make calls in a blink of an eye. If they had some help, they could be more confident and not make calls based on who is home. Score: 0.0 The red card in the first game and the red card in the second game were the pivotal calls in both games and both were wrong. Why does no one mention the acting of Ronaldo in the first game that resulted in that joke of a red card. Not sure what Casemiro would have had to do to get a card. Playing with 10 men, Munich went from dominating to trying to minimize the damage. The penalty awarded Munich was debatable. The offside calls were truly terrible, though, with the bad call on Lewandowski being so late (and wrong) as to be laughable, as indeed the Madrid supporter just behind the side ref did. It also appears offside doesn't apply when Ronaldo gets the ball. The reality is that the money has become so large that they need to get these games properly and accurately called. Use video to double-check all goals for offsides and the ball crossing the goal line (in use many places). Also require its use for any red cards. A sending off completely changes a match. Clubs should also be able to appeal blatant non-calls. Players are clever with many divers (Ronaldo in particular) that changes the game as well. Give a team 10 minutes to appeal for a red card with a video official making the call It would also be nice to consider post-match cards for egregious fouls that are not called. Why should a player get away with dangerous play without consequences. It would change behavior for the better. Finally, a team should be able to halt play for a rules error, which we are being to see crop up in England. There is no way to reverse a misjudged offside call that will be fair and missed yellow cards are also not worth exploring as all these changes affect the pace & flow of the match. That and goal line tech in all matches Score: 1.0 Crybaby coaches are a factor in our under-nine-year-old divisions, too. Soccer is a continuous sport. The day we go to video refereeing is the day the game dies. What a comeuppance for Bayern, a team not really used to losing -- Even with their strong defensive duo Jerome Boateng & Mats Hummels back on the field after injuries and killer striker Robert Lewandowski, whose hat-tricks have almost become routine, they were no match for Ronaldo who was on fire! Schade, but Alles gute, Jungs! Score: 2.0 You well know that I am no Bayern partisan, but that was an appalling display by Kassai, now second favorite Hungarian to Puskas in Real's reckoning. Score: 0.0 Ronaldo caught fire once Bayern was down to 10. In fact RM ought to have been playing with 10 much earlier in the game. It was very poor officiating, all through the game. Ronaldo's contribution looks good at first blush, but is less than it appears. Score: 4.0 Yes human error are a part of the sport. Saying the game is faster (not by much - c'mon) is a cop out. Ronaldo's second goal was clearly offside!! That completed deflated Bayern - who unjustly was playing down a man! The refereeing was as bad as an NBA playoff game. Score: 3.0 Real Madrid won nothing. Score: 1.0 Everyone who follows the game is grappling with the issue that it is impossible to referee accurately. Every game has mis-calls for offsides because it requires the linesman to be looking in two places at the same moment. I am of two minds. Technology can definitely improve the situation, as goal-detection has proved. But there is also something timeless about the flow of the game with its imperfections and unexpected twists. Perhaps it tutors us on the uncontrollable vagaries of life itself. Score: 4.0 Soccer at its highest level has unfortunately become a game of chance. Even the very best referees are utterly incapable of properly officiating a match. The players are too fast and too skillful. Soccer is played on a pitch that is approximately the same size as a U.S. football field with 11 players to a side and is a nearly constant-action sport (while U.S. features 11-12 minutes of action), yet U.S. football has EIGHT referees, all with full authority to call penalties, while soccer has ONE referee and two to four useless milquetoast referees' assistants.  In an ultra-low-scoring sport, refereeing errors are magnified and increase the likelihood that these errors will change the outcome of the game. Poor Mr. Kassai is not incompetent or corrupt, he's simply trying to perform an impossible task. The fault lies not with him but with the traditionalists at FIFA, UEFA, the English FA, etc., who all undoubtedly still arrive at work every day on horseback because, you know, it worked just fine 150 years ago. Score: 3.0 I agree with what you say on the state of the game - but not the rest. I'm sorry - but those calls were not even close. Close calls being errors are indeed part of the game - but again these weren't close. Score: 1.0 The game is played on a field about 30% larger, in area, than an American football field (75 yard width v. 54), and is longer, as well. American football uses seven officials, these UEFA matches five, two of whom contribute next to nothing, two who try to get offsides calls right, with wildly variable success, yesterday was appallingly bad, and one with too much responsibility and way too much ground to cover. Do what hockey did, go to two central referees, one in the midst of things, the other trailing the play. Score: 2.0 Video would help in correcting some of his mistakes last night, but not all. His decisions regarding not to give Casemiro a second yellow and to give Vidal a second (for something that wasn't even a foul) would not be reviewed. Score: 8.0 Vidal's red card was the strangest I have ever seen. His sliding tackle clearly got the ball, and only the ball. He did not even make contact with his opponent, who subsequently ran into Vidal's legs and tumbled. Rory Smith's attempt to say that the referee made mistakes on both sides is simply wrong. Robben was clearly kicked in the legs inside the penalty zone. Yes, he fell spectacularly, as Robben often does, but all theatrics aside it is still a penalty. And Zidane's claim that Bayern's second goal was from an offside position is ridiculous; it was a clear own goal by Real. Referees have clearly a tremendous influence on the game, and in this case it was disastrous. I am not sure that video replays are the answer either. Score: 0.0 If they can't get off side right in the Champions League I hate to think how badly it is called at lower levels. Soccer should follow (field) hockey's lead and drop off side from the rules. Score: 7.0 The ref didn't throw the game to Real Madrid. He lobbed it to them. Score: 4.0 It was painful to watch these blunders in a well-played, energetic game: unusual to see such a preponderance of errors on crucial plays and, on balance, clearly favoring one side. Troubling, too, that the offside call on Ronaldo was missed shortly after he had complained about a correct offside call. Score: 1.0 After 6 years of living in London and enjoying education and exposure to football, I can make a few observations (with poor grammar). Great game. Incredible athletes. Irrepressible cheaters. If refs didn't need to spend so much time watching for rampant play acting, they could catch the more obvious infractions. The Hand of God lives and the home team never cheats. Still, the best game going. Acting, crummy refs, elation, disappointment and the cry of next yer cannot be avoided. Score: 4.0 I think the MLS should ask Viktor Kassai to referee. And ask his linesmen crew to come over as well. They'd fit right in with that sort of performance. What a shambles. Bayern Muchen was playing not only a very good Real Madrid, but also the officials. What when from a difficult task became impossible. The first game the refereeing was a bit iffy. The second was so bad as to appear to be almost biased and makes me want to start looking into the bank accounts of the officiating crew.

Owens Valley surface and groundwater is considered local water, even though it is imported from hundreds of miles away via the Los Angeles Aqueduct. In fact, the much-touted Los Angeles River restoration is mostly Owens River water from the Hyperion sewage treatment plant. Los Angeles has NOT made peace with the Owens Valley, as Mayor Garcetti has stated previously. Large expanses of native vegetation have died due to groundwater pumping.

Plus easily available and cheap drugs and services are an added advantage. All you have to do is to go to any beach community in LA County and you will find hundreds upon hundreds of healthy looking but unwashed young people camping out on our sidewalks and parking lots and doing whatever it is they do to wrangle up enough money for continuous partying. But after a few years of this, living hard both chemically as well as exposed to the elements, the body and the soul break down that that's when the mental illness and inability to function in society begins. Some of them eventually become so feral, for lack of a better word, that they refuse all housing and services entirely - always returning to the streets. I honestly think we need a two-pronged approach. Yes, criminalize homelessness for those new arrivals which will serve two goods - get them off this downward cycle and away from their crime-ridden lifestyles, and stop newcomers from arriving. Then second, emphasize intensive services for the habitual homeless, including perhaps involuntary services for those most service resistant.

Even middle class families are stretched to the limits with the cost of rents. His big initiative is getting the Olympics to Los Angeles, something that will not get anyone out of their sidewalk tents. That Garcetti compares himself to Bill Clinton is an indication to me that he is just another old-guard Democrat who wants to keep his job by doing nothing of substance and claiming victory.

Stamina & effort- fierce competitive focus - have been the bedrock of Nadal's success. Unfortunately, with many big & small injuries- that effort is easily undermined. Nadal has struggled with waves of doubt, loss of 100% physical confidence. Did Toni promote misguided training strategies ? Did overdeveloped muscles contribute to knee & wrist problems ?

But that is not an argument against acknowledging, and celebrating, the special bond that can arise between an African American teacher and his or her African American student, and the great good that can do the student in this not yet post-racial world. - Now the NYTimes is actually promoting racism. the outcry that would have triggered. The world gets more chaotic from one day to the next. No one knows what they think or believe any more and they change with the wind with no rhyme or reason. I'd say if you have your head on straight, you might just be better off not reading anything in the media, to fill your head up with nonsense. I think it is difficult to read Jackson's piece and not be tempted to conclude that for example, no white male student should ever have a black or hispanic or asian or female teacher. This is not to downplay the problem of racism, but the need to have teachers one can relate to along with material that is relevant (e.g. of one's race, color, creed, gender, etc.) has become all pervasive. Shockingly, there's a lot to be learned by everyone from Dead White European Males. I agree that a teacher of a certain race might be easier for someone of that race to relate to, but the goal of this article should not be to get African-American students, African-American teachers. The article should be about ending racial boundaries. The reason the students would find it easier to relate teachers of their race is because of racial boundaries that have been set up in our society. Score: 6.0 I have worked in Philadelphia schools for over forty years with children from preschool to grade eight in public, Catholic and Christian schools. My students are Black, White, Asian and Latino. Many of them are immigrants from over forty-five different countries. I have also worked with teachers who were from all age groups, races and genders. No identity group of teachers had better results with some identity group of students than others did. Some of the teachers were extraordinarily talented teachers and some were ineffective, unprepared, lazy, nasty and just plain horrible teachers. Excellent teachers taught almost all their students effectively regardless of the students' characteristics and poor teachers taught almost all of their students poorly regardless of their students' characteristics. In over forty years I have seen no evidence or indication that the matching or non-matching of teachers' and students' race effected the learning outcome in any way. I saw good teachers and bad teachers and students who were learning or not learning. The race of the teachers and students made no difference. We need more excellent teachers not more Black teachers or more White teachers matched with students of their own race. Go into any school and see for yourself."", ""sub dataset"": ""nyt""}",[],['']

But apparently Mr. deBlasio fails to realize this -- even as an ever increasing amount of luxury residences are being built and flooding an already over-saturated real estate market. Not everyone who is homeless is a substance-abusing criminal. And we're now at the point where even hard-working New Yorkers are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.

Score: 4 Opponents of these shelters rarely, if ever, offer viable alternatives to the locations planned in their communities. And while residents can and do have reasonable fears, those fears - which in some cases involve lower housing prices and in others physical safety - must be balanced against the legal right and moral necessity of providing housing for all New Yorkers. My sense is that the reduction in housing prices and increases in crime, if any, cost less than the benefit of providing the housing. Score: 5 There are reasons that many homeless people choose life on the streets instead of inside a shelter; one of those reasons is the lack of safety. Fights, stabbings, theft, etc are common and there is little oversight from the shelter operators. Homeless shelters are a big business here, with the well-being and upward mobility of the residents merely an afterthought. I think it's perfectly reasonable for communities to oppose shelters until the City can demonstrate safety for the shelter residents and surrounding neighborhoods.

For those of us born in New York City, who have lived here for over 60 years and remember when we didn't have to lock our doors, let alone see trash on the streets, it's a little difficult to read someone's telling us to go live elsewhere. There are many types of homeless people. There are elderly widows whose Social Security won't cover even their rent-stabilized apartments. There are couples who have suffered a catastrophic illness that wipes out their savings. There are guitar-wielding young people from other states, who want to make it big in the Big Apple and find themselves on the streets. There are the undereducated women who began having babies at the age of 15 and now say they cannot control or even house their six children. Then there are the often psychopathic, sometimes criminal, individuals who cannot keep or even get a low-level job. If they're given meds, they certainly don't take them. They howl on subway platforms and pace around on less crowded subway cars, roaring threats to other subway riders, all of whom suddenly find the subway advertisements most engrossing.

Lange is fantastic with her haughty demeanor masking a hurtful past and fear of ageing. Other than the fact that Susan Sarandon has Bette Davis's eyes, I would have cast her as Joan Crawford and Jessica Lange as Bette. So far, I see Lange giving a strong performance as a Hollywood diva but I do not see Crawford in her the way I see Bette in Sarandon. Maybe is all that unfortunate face-lifting but she seems too grotesque and Crawford, in spite of all her incarnations, was always delicate and seemed to glide across the screen. Lange is a different woman. Score: 2.0 I really love this series. My only complaint is that Joan Crawford gets more screen time than Bette Davis. Susan Sarandon is brilliant. She has Bette Davis' voice and mannerisms down perfectly. Susan, and she does it very subtly which is quite a beautiful thing to see. She is wonderful , love Alfred Molina Score: 5.0 I've been intrigued at the amount of either/or in the comments concerning Lange and Sarandon.

Score: 3.0 Your summation on the theme of legacy and how it winds through the various character subplots was on the mark. My own take: that the consideration of legacy brings with it the fear of being out of time, which in turn propels Joan, Bette and Bob Aldrich to take significant risks with their fading careers. In short, risk is the other big theme in last night's episode, and clearly, whatever deals they made, all three understood it was an enormously risky move to agree to return to the set to make Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte.  As the show depicts, all three - Crawford, Davis and Aldrich - initially responded with an emphatic no and were each incredulous at the notion they should come together for another project. But they rolled the dice and finally agreed, knowing it was the only hope - perhaps the last hope - of reclaiming momentum in their fading careers. Legacy, I suppose, is an endgame, and endgames can be perilous. Score: 10.0 Jessica Lange's performance as Joan Crawford is brilliant. Ryan Murphy is giving us great television! I hope the networks are paying attention. Score: 3.0 Best camp ever! Susan captures a part of who Davis was. I think Davis was more stable and a bit nicer. Lange plays the part as pure camp, but a real performance was present last evening when the flowers were tossed at Mamacita. For those unsure of Lange's range/ see her in Gray Gardens. Score: 0.0 Both Lange and Sarandon are great in their roles, but what bothers me a little about Lange has something to do with the rat-on-plate scene from the real movie Joan spins around in her wheelchair, stopping after a time in tears. She seemed so grownup and mature. Joan Crawford had a much more mature aura (or something) than she does in this movie. Remember the scene in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane when Joan tells Bette that she's still in this chair, and how Bette wouldn't be able to do the things to her if she was not? Joan seemed so much more intelligent there than she is portrayed in Feud. Score: 4.0 I would argue that the series is not primarily from Crawford's point of view. Moreover, Sarandon is a much better actress than Lange and generally keeps Davis away from being a caricature, whereas Lange doesn't always succeed in making Crawford sympathetic. Sarandon captures the essence of Davis' look because she also is not a conventional beauty, whereas one time model Lange really doesn't inhabit Crawford in the same way, although the effort does cover up her excessive amount of character-diminishing plastic surgery. Score: 6.0 First and foremost: to state that Sarandon is a much better actress than Lange is something that can be argued ad infinitum. They are both excellent and quite different. Although Lange did start her career as a model, she has by now expanded her range way beyond Sarandon's with her work on television and on Broadway, winning accolades and awards everywhere she's been. Also, keep in mind that, when playing Crawford, Lange has to deal with the enormous ghost of Faye Dunaway's performance win Mommie Dearest, while Sarandon is basically dealing with the legacy created by drag queens. Score: 3.0 Only this most recent episode was from Crawford's point of view. The show does a good job of going back and forth, and showing things from each's point of view. And Lange is just as good an actress as Sarandon; she inhabits Crawford without going Faye Dunaway-like over the top. Great supporting performances for Victor Buono actor and Catherine Zeta-Jones' de Havilland, too! Score: 1.0 not sure if that matters to you. I love both of these women and their work. Score: 15.0 BEST thing on TV. Watch each episode at least twice. Score: 17.0 I enjoy the two principals, but for me the real satisfaction in the series is the pitch perfect casting of the supporting roles, in particular Jackie Hoffman as Mamacita, and, of course, Judy Davis as Hopper. Both women shone in last night's episode, as we saw Mamacita draw a line with Crawford You are blotto.), and Hopper ready to throw Crawford under the bus in order to achieve the greatest story of her career before her heart gives out. Score: 8.0 And Stanley Tucci's scenes are wickedly good. Score: 3.0 I totally agree, Hoffman and Davis have really made something of these supporting roles.

All elements must have some sort of formatting structure; though the effect of that formatting structure would vary according to the output medium. display controls the formatting structure rather than visual appearance, the use of the word display is a relic from the fact that CSS1 only really considered visual media, and is a bit of a misnomer (cf the CSS term canvas). Name: Phill Jenkins Email: pjenkins@us.ibm.com To: w3c-wai-ig@w3.org Subject: RE: visibility of 'skip links' said There is also the option of putting some styling on the small clear image gif (on Focus) that would have a tool tip (title attribute) that would show up when tabbed to or when the mouse hovered over it. The sighted keyboard user would see the tool tip when tabbing to links, the blind user would hear the link, and the mouse user would see the tooltip when mousing around. The visual design debate still exists about how to identify that there is a link there. I hadn't heard of the visible arrow idea before. I have seen the use of plain old text (styled small) instead of an image link, but that was not well received by the visual design community. So, if the sighted keyboard user can live with using the tab key to find all the links, even those associated with very small image links, then most everyone is satisfied. There are problems with the screen reader and voicing browser support of visibility: hidden and display:none. This is a fundamental problem with the concept of screen readers since they come from a notion that if it isn't displayed, it isn't spoken. Some web developers don't know which property to use when (the spec alludes to a difference), and even if the screen reader and voicing browsers did agree and support them consistently, there is no guarantee that the properties would be used correctly. Screen Reader developers have a history of hacking around to get to their users some equivalent of what the sighted users gets. When developers hide content with display:none, it also needs to be hidden from the screen reader users. However the visibility:hidden property, if used correctly, could be a solution when the voicing browser, screen readers, and the multi modal browsers support it correctly. So for today I would recommend the very small image link solution. Name: Phill Jenkins Email: pjenkins@us.ibm.com To: w3c-wai-ig@w3.org Subject: Re: visibility of 'skip links' said the low vision keyboard user cannot enlarge the tool tip? The magnifier certainly can. And if the user doesn't need/have a magnifier, the browser should respect the system font settings for larger fonts. Windows is the only system I know of that has system settings for fonts. IE 5.5 respects the system settings and supports the keyboard navigation to links. I used high contrast extra large just fine with tool tips! Name: Phill Jenkins Email: pjenkins@us.ibm.com To: w3c-wai-ig@w3c.org Subject: RE: visibility of 'skip links' said I agree that the browser does have the requirement (some have the capability now) to skip over a chunk of links. And I agree this should be a discussion for the next revision of the standards, both 508 and WCAG. But, the requirement is to be able to jump to the main content when there are navigation links in the way. I believe there are really two requirements, skipping over a large set of links to avoid having to press TAB too often, but for the low vision, blind, and small screen user to *easily* get to (identify) the main content is another requirement. Putting the main content first followed by the navigation links is one solution. Coding the main content with the only H1 could also be another solution. Having a skip to main content is another solution that meets both requirements when the navigation links are first on the page. I did not cross-post this reply to the 508 list since it originated on the w3c-wai-ig list. Phill Jenkins, IBM Research Division - Accessibility Center"", ""sub dataset"": ""email""}",[],['']

I would say that you want your content to be compatible with user agents and assistive technologies available in the language of the content. So, if the content is in English, you have a lot of options. If the content is in French or Russian or Tagalog, you have fewer. Maybe that should be a checkpoint? As to the issue of affordability, I don't think it is reasonable to put the entire burden on the web author. The user has some responsibility to find and use the technologies he needs. Remember the wheelchair analogy -- it's the building owner's responsibility to build the ramp, and the wheelchair-user's responsibility to buy the wheelchair. If he can't afford the wheelchair, or the electricity to charge it, he may need to find funding for it (from governments, charities, family, etc).

It is not possible to, say for example, turn all the images off (which would decrease download time) Also this brings us back to the problem of file download and sizes - instead of opening a page, the user is required to download information which may be many hundreds of pages long. This poses a problem for people using modems (any kind of modem) instead of broadband (and even for people using broadband if it is a particularly large file). It causes problems for regional users (and their electric fences for those OzeWAI attendees). It costs more to the user. And in order for people to access these PDF files they need the latest version of Jaws. As Jaws retails at several thousand dollars (depending on which currency), this isn't something that people will do every year. yes we require that people have their own assistive technology, whether it be a wheelchair or a screen-reader.

A Martian should be free to use Martian > digits in their names. Are you proposing to allow them as the first character of a name? Are they letters or digits? The question is not whether they are letters or digits in limbo, but whether they appear in common words. In English I can have element type identifiers first, second, third, etc. The equivalent Japanese of these would (if my imperfect knowledge doesn't embarrass me too much) be spelled using ideagraphs numbers, no matter what counter suffix was used. Similarly, I could have an element type identifier miscellaneous in English, but in Japanese I might wish to use gomoku (as in yakisoba :-), whether the go is 5. Personally, I can see no great value in allowing anything other than [01-9] as DIGIT in SGML and XML. It just seems to complicate things, and IMHO is a spurious and unthinking kind of i18n. [01-9] conveys all the meaning needed, and everyone understands it. Making the ideograph numbers into SGML/XML DIGITs means that users of native-language markup will be forced to use second-best terms, or to spell out kanji in kana, for many common words.

However, if you look at the Guidelines for UK Government websites (http://www.e-envoy.gov.uk/publications/guidelines/webguidelines/handbook/handbookindex.htm) it will outline what the Government requires for its own sites and those of the public sector.

Furthermore, I would have a look at Martin Sloan's take on the DDA in the UK, available at: http://elj.warwick.ac.uk/jilt/01-2/sloan.html Having said all this, I would agree with Charles that double-A standard is a good target to aim for as a minimum, but if triple-A compliance is at all possible (even if not on all pages) then I would strive for that.

Strictly speaking, this is an issue of validation, not parsing, i.e. the software involved need only be a recognizer, not necessarily a parser. (A similar comment applies to syntax directed translation via attribute or transduction grammars, where the need to preserve the semantic content -- or intent -- can introduce tradeoffs in algorithms between scope and efficiency.) AFAIK, most recognition algorithms actually exploit nondeterminism in the sense that they work as NFAs rather than DFAs (sometimes even constructing states and transitions on the fly), because the problem is to validate an instance as an admissible member of a class without necessarily preserving a parse tree (like a non-constructive existence proof.) , the only advantage of deterministic content models is forwards compatibility with unreviewed 8879.

Furthermore, with the parser generators that I have to hand, in no case does an ambiguous content model complicate the task. Furthermore, since we've lost the tag miminization that opens the trap that I have been told the ambiguity exclusion exists to patch, I can't imagine why an XML parser author would *want* thus to constrain DTD authors, aside from a desire to comply with a non-useful clause in a standard that is there only to ensure compliance with another standard, which in any case is likely to be amended soon to remove this problem.

I run Tidy on Windows NT 4.0. Since filtering a file is very straightforward task, I rather use Explorer shell than a specific GUI. I think this applies to any 32-bit Windows. On the Registry branch \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\htmlfile\\shell (or \\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\NetscapeMarkup\\shell if Netscape is the default browser) create an entry Tidy with content T&idy!. Of course, you need administrator priviledges and some knowledge of using Regedit. 2) Under Tidy-key, create a command entry with content [path]Tidy.exe -options %1 where [path] is the directory where Tidy.exe resides (not needed if the directory is included in Windows' path-variable) and -options are Tidy's own options. The %1 is the important part: it refers to the selected file. Now you can tidy up an .htm/.html file though a right mouse click & selection or through key strokes 'Win-listbutton' & 'i'.

The contention that non-validing implementations are not required to provide default attribute values and doctype nodes. This could be broken down into several subsets, those tests that require reading the external subset, those that require processing the internal subset, etc. You might review the Mozilla Dom L1 Core test summary that I did last November Whether no effect when defined to be null takes precedence over the NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR exception clause for setNodeValue.

Until last week, there was a licensing conflict that prevented the redistribution of SSL Lynx, but not of the patches and Lynx independently. Commercial use would have required royalty payments in the USA, and possibly other countries. The patent on RSA has now expired, and the Lynx mailing list is currently considering the implications. There are still some issues to do with US export legislation, although this probably amounts to getting the electronic paperwork straight, as the export controls on opoen source software were greatly relaxed early this year; SSL Lynx would not have been exportable this time last year. Note the copyright on RSAREF is probably still valid, so previous US builds are probably still non-redistributable, but an OpenSSL version should be. some of the symmetric ciphers that can be used in SSL may be still in patent, but (IANAL) I believe that DES and triple DES are out of patent and that MD5 is royalty free. SSL, itself, is patented (by Netscape), but royalty free. RSA was not royalty free for commercial users, and Lynx's GPL requires the software to be royalty free for all potential users.

The problem with this behavior is dealing with cyclic references. A server implementer may allow cyclic BINDings, in which case DELETE becomes very expensive, since the server must now validate that there is still a valid path to the destination resource from the root, to avoid orphaned cycles. Alternately, a server implementer can disallow cyclic bindings from being inserted in the first place, which is computationally much cheaper, but which restricts the usefulness of BINDings. Has any thought been given to a notion of a weak binding, which doesn't affect persistence? As long as weak bindings are automatically deleted when all of the strong bindings are removed, dangling BINDings (the great evil) are avoided. Especially when a DAV server is implementing something like a user space quota, a strong BINDing implies that the user creating it wants to maintain storage for the object (implying a quota impact), whereas a weak binding would be more like a smart bookmark that would follow a web page when moved and disappear if that page were removed. --Eric Sedlar Oracle Corporation Name: ccjason@us.ibm.com Email: ccjason@us.ibm.com To: Geoffrey M.

Then you wouldn't have to introduce fake bindings to maintain persistence? You could do it many ways. If I interpret Geoff's proposal correctly, a bindings to collections would use a symbolic link and all bindings to non-collections would us bindings. Your suggested approach could also be taken. In WebDAV bindings created via GET/MKCOL are no more privledged than those created with BIND. If you decided to implement them differently, then you'll have two types of situations to handle when a DELETE is requested. You'd have handle deletion of bindings to directories implemented as hard links and as symbolic links. The deletion of a symbolic link just works. Deletion of a hard link isn't quite so easy. You can't just delete it because all those symbolic links get broken. so instead you'll have to delete one of the symbolic links and then move the deleted directory to the location where the symbolic link was. And then also redirect any other symbolic links. Of course in order to do all this, you have to keep track of all your symbolic links and manage them during method processing. Geoff's approach makes these methods map to trivial file system operations and allows GC'ing to be defered I can tell you that if most Oracle customers are offered the choice of having a bunch of great neat content management functionality at the price of decreasing search performance, they will stick with the search performance. Nothing irritates users more than waiting for search results. You did mention text searches above.

We wanted to say that either both must end in a / or neither may end in a /. But in reality a trailing / is not a reliable indicator of the type of resource being addressed, so we should allow servers to process BIND requests even if the Request-URI ends in / and the Destination header does not, or vice versa. We agree with these comments and will remove the constraints from the description of the BIND method and the related examples. Yaron also objected to our saying that the Request-URI cannot just consist of /. That is, we currently say that you cannot use BIND to create a binding between the root and some resource. We say this because we define a binding to be a relation between a URI segment in its parent collection and some resource. That is, it's the triple (segment, collection, resource). Here there is no segment, and there is no parent collection. So you can't make sense of creating a binding for /. --Judy Judith A.

There's nothing in the syntax of the protocol to suggest that it can't be done or that there's anything special about it. Obviously we can't lock the parent of / if we wanted to lock a whole tree, but if we lock / itself, the URI protection feature will have the same effect. perhaps some implementations that might have to twist themselves a bit to handle this. Can any server implementers comment on the difficulty of this? Note: changing the root is sort of an academic case.

Check out Talking Blocks and Amberpoint for vendors who provide implementations. I do not consider it as an answer to my question: What do you mean by request? However, generally you are right that a complex client's request (task) may be broken into a number of sub-requests and routed separately to different services. Some of these services (if they are composite) may again decompose the sub-request into sub-sub-requests and send separately to different services, and so on recursively. Note that these different services may come from different providers / vendors. Hence, there MUST be *platform independent* uniform standard way/language to express requests. There is an attempt in this direction, see M. Papazoglou, M. Aiello, M. Pistore, and J. Yang. A Request Language for Web Services. Published at http://www.webservices.org/index.php/article/articleview/990/1/24/ However, specs of XSRL are not available. IMO the concept of request is crucial for web services technology. Perhaps this very issue should be addressed by W3C and the great IT vendors instead of trying to recover dying or already dead technologies.

The discussion covered dynamic resources, and a couple possible methods to generate ETags without too much pain Most interestingly, there was also a suggestion that ETags could be required only for resources that can be PUT to. I think I'm satisfied with this compromise, because it's precisely in the situation when a client is trying to PUT a resource body, that ETag support is needed. We've already discovered since 2518 was published that locks aren't the only tool necessary to prevent lost updates - you also need ETags. For read-only resources Etags are nice-to-have in some situations (like synchronization and caching) but there isn't the data loss possibility. Note that this would require that for any resource that supports PUT, the server MUST return the ETag header on each GET request - because the server can't tell when the GET request is received, whether the user intends to try to do a PUT later or not.

If a client decides not to use the locking protocol correctly (i.e. by updating a resource for which it does not have a valid lock), then of course something additional is required, but for a client that uses the locking protocol properly, locks are the only tool required to prevent lost updates.

In essence, what is being proposed, as I understand it is that we would have a new labeled graph node time, where the label would include the datatype and the lexical form, which would globally, unambiguously, and consistently denote a particular datatype value. But RDF already has a type of labeled node that is intended to be used to globally, unambiguously, and consistently denote a resource. It's a URIref node. Just as RDF need not look inside URIrefs to test potential denotational equality of string-unequal URIs, likewise RDF will not itself look at datatypes and make any determination about equality of datatyped literals which have string-unequal lexical forms with identical datatypes. In both cases, applications are free to parse the URIs themselves to make such determinations, but both kinds of comparisons are external to RDF itself. Therefore, there is no reason why a URI would be any more restrictive to RDF level processing than some other new form of node label -- which will be treated just as opaquely as URIs.

In Webdav, we've been pursuing using links and site maps to do clustering, and it seems that so far we can handle these issues by having separate resources with a relationship between them, and having the lock operation work on the separate URLs. It might be that in one implementation  is a byte range of http://server.dom/resource, but we don't need to standardize on that, only the relationship between them. Clearly we have to address the container/contained relationships, that locking a chapter has some effect on the lock state of the entire book.

Better make sure that the fonts you are about to embed by one method or another can be embedded. Emigre fonts, FontFonts (from FontShop) and many of the smaller libraries do not permit users with normal licenses to embed fonts in pdf files, or in webpages.

One alternative approach that I've seen used (but never used myself) is to use a small group of onagers. The onagers are kept behind other units for protection so they don't get attacked right away, and they all attack at once once they get in range. This only works if they are fully upgraded, and even then this is basically a sacrificial strategy, you you will end up losing your onagers to the war wagons that survive the initial attack.

Note that that solution has no over current / over temperature protection. Answer ID: 219832 Score: 6 Well, if you reverse the zeners it will work in principle. In practice, not so well. The problem is that zeners come with a tolerance, with about 5% as the norm. So your nominal 5.6 zeners, which drop a total of 11.2 volts, could produce a real voltage of anywhere from 11 to 12.2 volts. The larger voltage, obviously, will not provide good regulation, and the lower voltage will draw more current from the supply and dissipate more power in the resistor. Rather worse is the effect of that 100 ohm dropping resistor. Since all your op amp current flows through it, any current at all will affect the supply voltages, and this is a recipe for your op amps oscillating. A total of 10 mA, for instance, will drop 1 volt in the resistor and the zeners will be completely ineffective. A better virtual ground circuit would be something like simulate this circuit \u2013 Schematic created using CircuitLab For the transistors shown, a virtual ground current of about +/- 50 mA seems reasonable, which is about 300 mW in the affected transistor.

C1 and C2 also don't need to be anywhere that large. It might be useful to use two LDOs to make clean and better regulated \u00b15 V from the \u00b15.6 V. This concept will only work for low current levels. You are starting with 12 V, and the two zeners will drop 11.2 V, leaving 800 mV maximum across R1. The maximum current before the voltages start dropping significantly is therefore (800 mV)/(100 \u03a9) = 8 mA. If that's enough, then you're OK. If not, you need to decrease R1 or use a different topology altogether. The limit on how low R1 can go is the maximum dissipation of the zeners. For example, let's say they are good for 200 mW (200 mW)/(5.6 V) = 36 mA, which is the maximum the zeners can pass without blowing up. (800 mV)/(36 mA ) = 22 \u03a9, which is the theoretical minimum R1 can be. However, there are various souces of slop, so I'd probably not make it less than 47 \u03a9. If you need more current than represented by the above, then use a switcher to make the -5 V supply from the +12 V supply, and a linear regulator like a 7805 to make the +5 V supply. The 12 V supply negative lead is then also the ground for everything. Answer ID: 219930 Score: 2 Your zener diodes has the right orientation. Nothing wrong there. But your circuit have some other problems. You will get in trouble when you only have an nominal voltage drop of 0.8V over your resistor. The current through the zener diodes will be much too sensitive to both input voltage and the voltage across the zenerdiodes. If the current through the zenerdiodes gets too low then you loose your virtual ground. It all depends on the usage. if you only need a virtual ground ref, then just use a resistive voltage splitter (e.g. 2x1k).

There are some models which have spring-loaded cylinders mounted around tilted teeth: when you spin it to one side, the cylinders slip. When you spin it to the other side, the cylinders are caught between opposite surfaces, and torque is transmitted by friction (there is no positive engagement between parts). Lots of backpedal-brake rear-hubs have this system. Shimano had a Deore LX named Silent Clutch with this mechanism, but it was heavy. Also, I know at least one model (American Classic) which instead of the spring to load the pawls, have a rotary disc to engage and disengage the pawl, and a tiny hair-sized spring which act as the freewheel for this plate. </s>Answer ID: 8107 Score: 8 Hub integrity can not really be judged by noise alone, but by feel. If you feel it slipping under load the hub could be damaged beyond repair. The quiet smooth feel, but working normally is just a good, sealed hub that the manufacturer built in a way that has smaller or less splines. The full monty. A free wheel hub consists of a few key elements. The splined hub body, springs and pawls. The spline is a series of ramped teeth. Slipping one direction, gripping the other. This allows the coasting. Fancy hubs may have more splines than cheaper ones. The pawls are little teeth that grip the spline, and are spring loaded to keep them engaged when the cassette body is spinning faster than the hub. So as a hub wears, its usually the splines or the pawls loosing their crisp shape, or the springs in the pawls no longer being strong enough to keep the pawl engaged. Answer ID: 8105 Score: 5 It very much depends on the freewheel mechanism in the hub, some make a nice clickerty noise, others are more silent.

The Crusades ended in 1271, and what happened in 1291 the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem was the result. Detailed Answer: The Crusades were seasonal and ended in 1271 not 1291. The Crusades were typically done in response to Papal calls to arms. Crusades had a beginning and an end even if individual Crusades lasted for years, they always ended. Crusaders were like militant tourists, looking to have their tickets punched. Looking to do their bit, and go home. Thus the period of the Crusades (1096 and 1271) was actually a series of 9 different crusades. First Crusade: 1096 - 1099 - The People's Crusade - Freeing the Holy Lands. led by Count Raymond IV of Toulouse and proclaimed by many wandering preachers, notably Peter the Hermit Second Crusade: 1144 -1155 - Crusaders prepared to attack Damascus. led by Holy Roman Emperor Conrad III and by King Louis VII of France Third Crusade: 1187 -1192 - led by Richard the Lionheart of England, Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I.

Which was kinda a result of the end of the Crusades. Without the Periodic inflow of new armies, which is what the Crusades were, European influence and military foothold on the ME was destined to collapse. Why did the Crusades end? No one reason.

It's not quite as light-weight but it doesn't cost as much either. There are also stainless steel cooksets, which are even heavier but typically even cheaper than aluminum. Regardless of whic you choose, it'll be lighter than cast iron! are you specifically expecting to cook in/over an open fire? If so you may need to consider different cookware options.

After it's cooked, just brush off the ashes. You should probably try this at home a time or two before you do it for real in the woods - personally, I find the gritty taste of ash (that didn't brush off) to be un-appetizing. Obviously, this won't work very well if rain is falling on your campfire. For cooking on a stove, check your local thrift store for a wide, medium-sized aluminum pot with no lid.

A good starting point in selecting interesting combinations is to look at the densities across different styles . Pick two that are widely different and find bottles of each.

This crippled the established character of Han, who was originally written as a scoundrel with a strong sense of self-preservation. Han shot first is how we complain in response. It's easier/quicker than saying Han solo shot Greedo at the first opportunity he could to save himself because that's what a smuggler running from a crime lord he cheated would do.

Answer ID: 5562 Score: 15 A thought occurred to me today that helps explain it. The alternative to Han Shot First is Greedo Never Fired The second is definitely more accurate: Greedo did NOT fire in the original theatrical version. That said, the fan outrage was geared towards inciting a more general outrage or at least making sure everyone knew WHY the fans were outraged. Greedo is a minor character who spends less than 5 minutes on screen, is hardly referenced in the EU, had no memorable lines, and is only notable for being a complete idiot. Han was played by Harrison Ford. He was in all 3 movies. He has an extensive presence in the EU. His list of quotable lines is longer than a child's arm. He was on virtually every poster. Han is almost as universally recognized as being tied to Star Wars as the lightsaber. Therefore, their mantra had to feature Han. Secondly, Han Shot First is an action statement - it says something about the character. It is a definite action that he took, and it is clear enough to reference the scene implicitly. Greedo Never Fired rather says what a character didn't do. It doesn't give us a clear picture of Greeo's character, it doesn't say what he would have done, it simply says he didn't fire. The choice between an action statement and a passive statement is clear. Han Shot First is simply a stronger statement, and it is much more memorable.

There were multiple beings who wanted to fire their guns, Han was the first person to do so. You're reading it as the first way, but if you read it the second way it makes sense. Han and Greedo both wanted to shoot each other, but Han got there first. You could say this in many other cases; for instance, I was going to go to the breakroom for some free donuts, but everyone else got there first. That definitely does not imply that I still got a donut. Han shot first could be a reference to the 'first' version of the film, in which Han was the only person who shot.

It's called a hand because of the simple fact that you literally have to hold the cards in your hand. Here's a picture of a typical hand: In a standard deck of playing cards, there are four suits: diamonds, clubs, hearts and spades. And the trump suit is a suit that has been chosen to have the highest value in a particular round of the game (or for the duration of the entire game, depending on the game being played). In other words, with cards of the trump suit, you will be able to beat any other card of the non-trump suit. If both cards are trump-suit cards, the one with the higher rank wins. So, the phrase the trump suit for the hand means that one of the four suits has been designated to rank above all others for that particular round of the game.

In some card games (Bridge is a good example), one of these suits will be designated the trump suit.

There are a number of idiomatic uses of the word trump derived from this which are used generally in other contexts. </s>Answer ID: 161032 Score: 2 One hand, in card playing games, is the time after the cards are dealt until the cards are re-dealt: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_card_game_terms#deal There are various usages depending on the specific game, and regional variations. for instance, some refer to a hand as a single instance of play in a game where each player contributes one card to the middle, then one player takes those cards (hearts, euchre, rook, etc). However these are tricks, not hands - just be aware that the term hand is sometimes misused. In your case, the card placed face up represents Trump until the point in the game where the cards are collected and re-dealt to players. This doesn't mean the gameplay ends. Some games tally points at the end of each hand and deal another hand, continuing play until another goal is met.

Question tags: <stm32><impedance><impedance-matching> Accepted answer ID: 402819 Score: 1 How do I find the output impedance of the STM32H743 (and potentially other similar devices)? I've looked through the datasheet (DS12110 Rev 5) and the reference manual (RM0433 Rev 5) however haven't found much information. I'm mostly interested in the SPI lines, and want to match the track impedance to the output impedance using a series resistor. For now I've put in placeholders of 33R, thinking the PCB trace could be around 50R and the output impedance around 20R. </s>Answer ID: 402819 Score: 4 Output impedance of (typically CMOS) output driver for any MCU can be calculated/estimated from VOH and VOL electrical characteristics from datasheets . The meaning of this table is that if a 8 mA load is connected to ground and GPIO is driven HIGH, the drop between Vcc and output is 0.4 V. It means that the internal equivalent impedance of GPIO port, per Ohm's Law, 400mV/8mA = 50 Ohms. Same calculations are valid if the load is connected to Vcc, and the pin is driven to LOW. The table says the residual voltage is no more than 400 mV. Again, it is equivalent to 400/8=50 Ohms or less. There is one caveat however. Most MCU have simplified GPIOs, where the impedance depends on load. In this particular case the specifications (same Table 60) says that the voltage drop is 1300 mV if the load takes 20 mA, which makes the output to have roughly 1300/20 = 65 Ohms. In short, VOH and VOL data at specified load give you an estimation of output impedance of CMOS GPIO driver under 65 Ohms worst case (for STM32H743), and likely close to 40-50 Ohms typical. If your track's impedance is 70-100 Ohms, you will need to add a 22-33-47 Ohm series resistor at driving side if you want a neat waveform. Answer ID: 402790 Score: 2 It's not common to specify the output impedance of digital logic, because the voltage/current behavior is nonlinear.

Answer ID: 402805 Score: 1 The output impedance will vary as the output FETs are turned on and then turned off; the operating region is the FET_IN_TRIODE, once the FET is solidly on. In TRIODE, the FET looks like a fairly linear resistor, as long as the voltage excursions are less than 50% of the FET threshold voltage; with Vthreshold of 0.3 volts (an estimate of numerous modern CMOS processes), you can have 0.15 volts reflection and still have a fairly dependable RESISTOR action. However the output impedance will VARY with temperature, and with VDD, on the PCB. And well or tub or bulk noise will also affect the FET behavior, tho you may not detect this minor delta_Rout. And as the semiconductor foundary implants atoms to form the Nchannel and Pchannel devices, there will be variations in the conductivity (the output resistance) because thermal annealing will not be precise. Depending on the exact implanting used, the channel doping may be the DIFFERENCE of two implant cycles, and slight errors of implant-time and spatial fluctuations of implanting because of variations in the plasma-ion-cloud density will be magnified by the differencing.

They're also relatively uncorrupted by later additions to the series (both predate the prequels, and West End's game even predates the expanded universe). They're both pretty scrupulous in maintaining accuracy to the movie universe, too. That neither of these sources ever references some sort of generic Force healing as a thing is pretty conclusive that no such power is referenced in either the movies themselves or the script or background notes. (And in fact, West End's SW sourcebooks are some of the best 80s source material for official background material because of the extensive access they got to otherwise unpublished documents at the time). It's also not clear that Luke even needs healing in that scene in A New Hope. He's been knocked unconscious. There's no bleeding or other obvious trauma. A far better interpretation of the scene is that Obi-wan is checking to see if Luke's okay - not by searching for a pulse, but by using a Force power we know exists (sense) to check Luke's mental state. He determines Luke doesn't need medical care, and then shakes him a little to help him come to (after speaking to R2). the musical cues are not suggestive of healing Force powers at that point in the scene. The music has an edge of danger, emotionally pushing us towards wondering if Luke will be okay, and suggesting Ben is wondering the same. It's only as Ben tells R2 that he'll be fine that the music switches over to the Force/Obi-wan theme (it was obi-wan's theme in ANH, it only gets reified into the Force theme in later movies).

In the posted piece, one can imagine (but not play) the 3-beat rest before the quarter note. The point is to begin a melody on an unaccented beat. There need not be anything at the end of the piece to make up for the upbeat. In some styles (older but not outdated) of notation, a three-beat (in this case) measure appears at the end to balance out the measures. As three rests at the end of a piece do not represent a sound, the modern practice is to leave them out. Answer ID: 85268 Score: 4 It makes more sense when words are involved. The upbeat is often a less emphasised word than the one following it - which needs to be emphasised. Happy birth day to you. My bonn ie lies o ver the o cean. In order to get the emphasised word in the right place in the bar at the beginning (and anywhere else in the song!) it needs to be written with that upbeat. Sometimes it's several notes. And did those feet (in ancient times ). So yes, if it's written, it gets played. Usually, because a song is more than one verse, the last bar compensates for the anacrusis (pick-up, or in the OP's case, upbeat) by being short by that amount. It makes it easier to sing when looped round - it keeps the song, and those singing it, in time. So the last bar here has only three beats, so when it gets repeated, the fourth (last) beat gets played for the beginning of the next verse. Answer ID: 85310 Score: 1 The notes are played in the order they appear. This is explaining that sometimes the first bar doesn't always have as many beats as appears in the time signature. In this case you can imagine counting (1) (2) (3) [4], but the one, two and three are silent, and you start playing on the 4 beat. It is not necessary to actually pause for 3 beats. Just start playing on the 4. The second sentence points out that often the last bar will have as many beats as are missing from the first bar. For the last bar, you can imagine counting [1], [2], [3], (4), but the 4 is silent. This is the opposite of the first bar.
