John: How is everything going with your girlfriend?
Alex: Didn't I tell you? It's over!
John: Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I didn't know that you had split up. What happened?
Alex: It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up!
John: Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?
Alex: No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home!
John: What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her?
Alex: I wanted to, but I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, so I decided to just go home. I called her later that night, but she didn't answer the phone.
John: I can't believe she would do that to you. It's so dishonest—and rude!
Alex: I know. I still haven't heard from her. The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around.
John: I bet you she regrets what she's done. You were such a good catch! She really lost out, didn't she?
Alex: I guess so. It would be nice to know why she did this though.

John: Good morning. I’m from the New York book review. Could I ask you some questions about your latest book?
Author: Sure. Take a seat... what would you like to know?
John: First, I’ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story.
Author: That’s correct. It’s a murder mystery based on actual murders that took place in Florida several years ago. The main character—the police investigator—is based on the man who investigated the case.
John: How do you research your books?
Author: I always visit the places that I use as settings for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible—even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most characters are a mixture of the characteristics of two or more people.
John: I really like your books. I’ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulations on making the bestseller list yet again!
Author: Thank you. Let me sign it for you... there you go.
John: Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about?
Author: There’s a real mix of stories in the book. I haven’t finished all of them yet, though. Many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your business card, I’ll make sure you get an advance copy to review.

Mr. Sun: Good morning, Mrs. Smith.
Mrs. Smith: Good morning. You are Mr. Sun, aren't you? Take a seat, please.
Mr. Sun: Yes, thank you.
Mrs. Smith: I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University. Will you please tell me something about your related courses?
Mr. Sun: In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting, and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting, Commercial Accounting, Industrial Accounting, and Management Accounting.
Mrs. Smith: Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control?
Mr. Sun: No, we haven't taken such a course, but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making, by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making.
Mrs. Smith: From your school report card, I can see you did well in every course. But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience.
Mr. Sun: I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume. In fact, I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year. I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well. Here is the recommendation.
Mrs. Smith: You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English.
Mr. Sun: No problem. The professional English course is just English for Accounting. Moreover, as you know, the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture. When I served part-time there, I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English.
Mrs. Smith: That sounds fine. Why did you choose to apply to our company?
Mr. Sun: I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department. Her name is Lilling. She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested. I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company.
Mrs. Smith: Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees?
Mr. Sun: No, can you tell me about it?
Mrs. Smith: Of course. As for an entry-level accountant, we pay 1,500 a month in the first half-year. We have a grading system to evaluate your work. If you have made progress, we will certainly raise your salary. For beginners with a CPA certificate, they can earn at least 2,000 a month.
Mr. Sun: I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association, but the certificate won't come to hand until next month. How about that?
Mrs. Smith: I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July.
Mr. Sun: Thank you, Mrs. Smith. It is really a pleasure talking with you.

Alice: I watched a very interesting documentary about plants yesterday evening. It was called 'unusual plants' and looked at several species of plants from around the world which have unusual features.
Bob: Really? Tell me about some of the plants they showed.
Alice: Well. There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them.
Bob: Is that type of plant found in this country?
Alice: No, it isn't. it's a pity, because I'd like to see it in action.
Bob: So would I. what other unusual plants did they show?
Alice: They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, when the insect collects the nectar, it also takes some pollen from one flower to another.
Bob: That's very specialized. So, the insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, the other would too.
Alice: That's right. That's one reason why it's so important to protect every species.
Bob: I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.
Alice: According to the documentary, they have an incredible ability to find water supplies, however small, and then store them without losing much through evaporation.

John: I have never done this before and don't know where to begin as far as making an offer on this house.
Agent: Hi, just be relaxed. Leave the details of making the offer up to me. Now, please tell me. What were you thinking you should offer?
John: All I know is that I absolutely must have this house! And I think I shall pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or more.
Agent: It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?
John: I hope that the owners aren't insulted by that offer.
Agent: Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or make a counter-offer.
John: Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an acceptance?
Agent: It usually doesn't take very long for owners to respond to an offer.
John: Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers ready?
Agent: The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified for your loan.

John: So it looks like we start selling in the U.S. next year.
Chen: Did Mr. Lin put you in charge of marketing?
John: He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge, or whether he wants to hire an American. But even if he hires an American, I'll probably be transferred to our American office.
Chen: Where will it be?
John: We aren't sure yet. Maybe L.A. I think L.A. would be the best idea.
Chen: Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U.S.?
John: Yes, the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything. Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff. It's going to be good. We can compete more directly with them.
Chen: Great.
John: Our computers have a high level of quality now. We can demonstrate it. And our prices will be good. So I think it will really be worthwhile.
Chen: You seem excited about it.
John: Well, you know I studied marketing in America. So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team.
Chen: Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there.
John: Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves. It will be hard at first. But if we develop a good advertising campaign, I think we can break into the market.
Chen: The company will have to choose a good advertising firm. And then there's the problem of quality. How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good?
John: It takes some time. Because even if the quality is high, people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name. Name recognition is crucial.
Chen: Well, I hope it all works out, John. I think if you're part of the team, things will go well. But you know we'd all miss you here. So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving.
John: That's very nice of you to say. But if we set up an office there in the States, maybe you could try to become part of it.
