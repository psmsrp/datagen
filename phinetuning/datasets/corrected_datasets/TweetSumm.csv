Dave: Wow, expected 4 packages yesterday, but only 2 showed up. 50% failure rate-not impressed. Glad I paid for fast shipping. Last month driver delivered box, sat in van for 10 min on phone, and drove off. Then got notice that package was ""lost in transit"".
Agent: I'm sorry you only received two of the orders. Is this happening with the same carrier each time? We can see what options are available for the lost items, reach us by phone or chat here: https://t.co/hApLpMlfHN
Dave: Problems are mostly with AMZL US delivery, but this time it's UPS. UPS is usually pretty good. Also, the item isn't lost. I watched them deliver it. Status still says ""lost in transit"", though. No big deal, but it makes Amzn look silly.
Agent: Okay, thanks for that info, Dave. Have you received any updates via e-mail for the last two packages you were expecting? Let us know. We'd like to help in any way we can!
Dave: Got shipping refunded via chat, and packages will be here when they get here. Thanks for letting me vent.

Saim: Hello, doesn't seem like a customer's time/money is of value to you! Just because you are a low-cost carrier!? Never again!
Floi: Sorry for the delay, Saim. Flight Change is subject to Change Fee (per person/per flight) plus Fare Difference, so you only have to pay for those. If you think it's cheaper to make a new booking, you may consider so.
Saim: But how can the rescheduling charges be more than the ticket charges?
Ed: Really sorry as flight change is subject to change fee plus fare difference accordingly. Thanks.
Saim: I will go ahead with fresh booking, but will you move my baggage and food to the new booking?
Khairul: Hi Saim, we are sorry as the add-ons cannot be transferred to another booking. Thanks.
Saim: Never seen somebody so least bothered about customer... feel cheated and feel robbed... did not expect this from such a reputed airline...
Yana: Terribly sorry for the inconvenience but if you make a flight change, the baggage will be transferred to your new flight. However, if you make a new booking, it cannot be transferred since it is a totally different booking.
Saim: As a basic courtesy and for customer satisfaction, you can take so little effort... remember, a satisfied customer is the best marketing. It's a request, please support.
Floi: Really sorry Saim, but they're non-transferable and non-refundable. We just have to be fair to all of our guests; hence, ticket rules apply. However, you may opt for a tax refund in case of a no-show. Thanks for your patience.

Lucinda: The manager said it was an HQ issue not store so please explain?! Everything from the brown shoes on the left to the far right are girls. Please explain why? Boys need to wear shoes too!

I'm sorry you feel this way, I appreciate your frustration. We flex our space, and range, to support customer needs and perennial trends. We manage stock to each store to ensure we are giving a balanced offer.

Lucinda: So you're saying girls needed a choice of over 10 boots and 8 trainers and 10 shoes, boys only need one pair of boots and no shoes or trainers? Because that's what you're advertising. It is sexism and appalling of you to do this! Boys require clothes and choice just as much as girls! It in no way is balanced! Please provide me details to take this issue further? I cannot believe your bias to girls over boys. No explanation other than your wish for money! No thought to customers at all! 50% of kids are boys STOP DISCRIMINATING on sex!

Lucinda: Claiming 1 choice of trainer and boot for boys is balanced against over 10 choices of each for girls! How is that not discrimination and sexism? Boys not allowed choice cause they're boys?!

Calum: Hi Lucinda. I assure you this is not discriminating. There is just a much higher demand for female footwear than male footwear in our stores. Due to this big difference in demand we offer more female footwear as that is what our customers are more interested in investing in. This decision is down to our customers choices, and we try to change and improve to our customers needs and wants. Thanks.

Julie: We're sorry, Dan. If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up we're not responsible for contacting them on your behalf. However, if there's been a bag left behind we'll do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it.
Dan: When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar. They said you can't return theirs until mine has been returned. It's a bit annoying that you can't contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake. What are my options?
Linds: Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration. Unfortunately, we're unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know. You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company.

Kev: Hi Dan. If another passenger has your bag, you wouldn't be able to make a claim with us. You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them.
Dan: So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person whose bag was left and ask? Obviously I would but you wouldn't be able to give me their details. I've got presents etc. in the bag and no money to replace them now, so it's essentially ruined my Christmas.

John: Never flying with you guys ever again! A normal 5 hour trip turned into 15 hours and having to spend an extra $400. Unbelievable!
Customer Service: We do our best to always get you to your destination on time and apologize for the extended travel time.
John: Your delayed flight and plane issues with the jet bridge caused me to miss my connecting flight. I had no choice but to pay $400... why do I have to pay for something that was your guy's fault? Such a crazy amount for something that was because of your plane messing up.
Customer Service: If your tickets were in the same reservation, our team would rebook you at no added cost.
John: The same flight reservation only leaves once a day from DFW-BOI. I would've had to stay overnight in Dallas and miss an extra day. I needed to be in Boise that day so was forced to buy a connecting flight. Your flight delay/issues aren't something I should pay extra for.
Customer Service: Our agents are certainly able to assist with any but we're unable to offer reimbursements for flights purchased on another airline.
John: I purchased the connecting flight from you though. I was told to pay the PHX - BOI flight was the only way to get to Boise that day. So...??

Never mind, getting more & more delayed now. Seriously hate the trains. Given myself 2 hours spare to get to my final destination & now looking unlikely that'll be enough time.

Lewis: Hi Natasha. Sorry for the delay. The 15:41 service was delayed due to following a late running preceding service. Apologies for the problems this has caused. The next train to London Paddington us at 16:33.

Natasha: Ok, so due into London 40 mins later than planned (assuming we aren't delayed further...🙃), as the 16:33 takes 10 mins longer than the 16:03. At what point does this journey qualify for a refund (partial or otherwise)? So stressed.

Lewis: If delayed by an hour on that journey you can claim compensation.

Natasha: Beginning to look likely. Any idea when the signal problems will be fixed - currently stuck at Didcot Parkway with no departure est. Signal issues are so common in this area I've lost track of how often I've been delayed here.

Anna: Also, how do I import my iTunes smart playlist songs to Spotify?
Spotify Support: Hey there! You can try following the steps at https://t.co/jnWe28bxRW. Let us know how it goes. On the other hand, we're afraid that local files will not appear under Your Library (Songs, Artists, Albums).
Anna: Please do. I've worked the past 10 years on creating those playlists in iTunes, and the whole purpose of migrating to Spotify is that it's social. So now I don't have any benefits of being a Spotify subscriber... Is there really no workaround for this? I wouldn't mind putting some time into making this work, but Spotify just has so little use for me if this can't be done...
Spotify Support: We're afraid this isn't possible, but we can see how that'd be handy. Your feedback has been noted. Don't worry, once you've imported your iTunes tracks, you can easily move them to playlists by following the steps at https://t.co/a38Mc2DlCx /WP
Anna: I think I'm missing the point. That article doesn't say anything about iTunes or how to move songs added through iTunes to playlists :-(
Spotify Support: Sorry about the confusion. The steps you're looking for are on the first link we provided. Just head here: https://t.co/leBtTrQniD.
Anna: Yes, I already did that before I asked my initial question (about importing smart playlists).
Spotify Support: We understand where you're coming from. Currently, it won't be possible to do this. Rest assured, we'll let our devs know this is something you'd like to see /DV
Anna: Okay, thanks. How do I cancel my subscription? Is this possible each month, or is it per year?
Spotify Support: No problem. Canceling the subscription can be done anytime. Can you also let us know your account's username or email address? We'll see what we can suggest /DN

American Airlines Agent: We care about your experience and are here for you. Our apologies for the extra wait this morning. Did you need assistance with rebooking?
John: It is too late because of American staffing and not having customer service skills I missed my connecting flight which cost me money!!! I need to be reimbursed! Or compensated in some way or form. American Express even called for me to have this situated and your reservation department could not handle it and said it had to be done in the airport. Everyone keeps passing the puck!
American Airlines Agent: We ask passengers arrive with ample time to check in. We're sorry your flight was missed, but we're unable to offer anything further.
John: Time wouldn't be an issue if you had better customer-oriented staff and enough staffing as Delta does. I will never ever again fly with this company. Only reason why I got stuck with you guys is because my assistant thought I wanted a later flight rather than an early AM. Delta will always be my number one carrier as it has been. Never giving any other company a chance thanks to this company! Love you, Delta.

Alex: I'm never buying from a third party seller on this platform again. I took a chance on one that had 99% feedback and they're trying to pull a fast one on me.
PJ: Hi, I'm sorry to hear this. Without giving any personal information, can you tell us what problem you're having?
Alex: Hi PJ. I ordered a laptop from a 3rd party seller. They sent the right kind of laptop but it's lacking features that were in the description: it was supposed to be a 2-in-1 laptop meaning it should have a touchscreen and fold into a tablet. The laptop they sent lacked those features. I tried contacting the seller, they didn't reply. I submitted a claim, they finally replied saying they would give me a refund after they sent this laptop back, which is no bueno. I'm currently a student taking online classes and I need a computer of some kind, so going through all the steps of sending the laptop back, waiting for my refund to be available, and then ordering a new laptop and waiting for it to get here will take too much time. I just want them to send the right computer I ordered. I think I can manage sending them this one back first and waiting for the correct one. If you can help get me the laptop I ordered, that would be amazing.
CN: Hello! Apologies for the trouble this has caused. When did you file the claim?
Alex: It was yesterday and I received the reply like an hour ago.
Jenna C.: Have you replied to the seller expressing your concerns about returning the laptop? Have you also asked if they are able to send the correct laptop out?
Alex: Another representative (Jet N.) has emailed them on my behalf, but if it's gonna be like last time, I'm not expecting a speedy reply.
CN: We allow sellers 2 business days to reply. Keep us posted!
Alex: Also, I just want to let y'all know, all my anger and frustration is directed at this seller and not y'all. Amazon has actually been nice, professional, and helpful in trying to help me.
Jenna C.: Not a problem at all! We completely understand the frustration when problems occur! Let us know if you are able to get a resolution with the seller.

At 8:00 p.m. I got an email from MyChoice saying that my scheduled delivery was now rescheduled to Monday. No explanation, of course. Note of course that I lost a day and a half of paid time off for that. So today I head home again to wait, nothing. Around 5 I get an email from MyChoice saying they tried to deliver but ""the business was closed""! I'm not a business, my doorbell works, I was awake, door not even locked. I called, they said I’d hear back by 7 pm. To their credit, a guy did just show up but asked for help carrying the 140 lb box up the stairs? Good thing I’ve been going to the gym? In conclusion, next time a business tries to ship me something with MyChoice, I’m going to have to go elsewhere. Oh, and the drivers aren’t given phones so can’t contact customers with any kind of update or ETA? That is terrible.

Stacy: I'm on DL 2641 and I'm going to miss my flight due to traffic can you help to get me rescheduled on the next flight?
TJH: I'll be able to do confirm on DL2572, which is scheduled to leave at 9:00 AM for $75.
Stacy: I'm still in stand still traffic and I'm afraid I will miss that one too. Can you confirm on the next flight? The fee is fine.
TJH: Oh, no! There is one at 10:00, 11:21 or at 12:27, which one would work better for you?
Stacy: I know ... crazy..1121 is probably the safest bet the way this morning is going. Thank you for all of your help TJH! Delta always is so helpful.
TJH: You're most welcome. Please DM your phone number. I'd be glad to give you a call and set it up for you.

Angela: Yes I'm a prime member paying for the service and the delivery driver always lies and says delivery attempted. He says it's because Amazon fine him for delivering late so it's better for him to say he tried to deliver when he can't get round enough addresses. I have had someone in my house all day. No delivery attempted. I need the delivery for tomorrow and now it's not here and Amazon/their delivery partner is fibbing about trying to deliver. This has happened 8 times. You offered £5 credit, its cost me more than that in phone calls.

Apple Support Agent: Let's help take a closer look. Does this seem to persist after rebooting the device? Which apps are most in use when you experience these issues? Are all your apps up to date in the App Store?

Alex: Happens mostly in FB and Instagram. Installed and updated everything last night. Shut down phone last night, didn't help, haven't this a.m.

Maia: Hello, asking your passengers to stand in this line that wraps around out of sight to get to the train for the terminal at Orlando is unconscionable. You need to fix this with buses or something ASAP. It left a very bad taste in my mouth after a long trip.
Customer Service Agent: We understand that waiting in line after a long flight is not ideal, Maia. But the 'trains' between the Main Terminal and Gates 1-59 are currently being installed to replace the old ones.
Maia: I understand WHY they are being replaced and I understand it is the responsibility of the airport, but it is more than just not ideal. Traveling during the holidays is stressful enough. Being ok with cutting capacity in half is very disappointing. Is anything being done at all to ameliorate the issue? Or is it just a “too bad, so sad, not our problem” situation?
Customer Service Agent: Airport renovations are something we look closely at as we understand it will affect how our customers are able to get to and from their flights. We don't look to reduce flights as we know that takes travel options away, but we do look at available options and workarounds... that can be put into place in coordination with everyone involved at the airport to help things run smoother. Unfortunately, longer lines are part of the process until the improved product is finished.
Maia: And what is the workaround that has been put into place for this contingency? All that is communicated to passengers is ""we only have one shuttle running."" An earlier message also indicated busses might be used. That is all that is obvious to passengers. One might also question the wisdom of making these improvements during the holidays unless absolutely necessary. Also something not communicated to passengers.
Customer Service Agent: We understand this experience at the airport was not ideal. We appreciate you taking the time to share this feedback with us.

Joliz: She said ""I already spoke to my supervisor"" when I asked her why I couldn’t be transferred. To be clear, the reps I spoke with 4 hrs ago were great and were the ones who suggested I call back if the issue persisted. The issue persisted, I called back & despite me sharing what my prior convo was, the person ignored my questions & the fact I had just gone through all the steps 4 hrs ago & stuck to a script instead of directing me to support that could help. I’m a longtime prime member who's usually always had positive experiences with your customer service staff. This was not one of them. And more frustrating is that instead of moving me to a DM like most companies have to sort the issue, you have me publicly replying to you. Which hey, if that’s how you wanna handle it by all means. I’m just trying to get supplies to my family in PR over here.

Amazon Support: If you'd like to, feel free to DM us. We're here to help in any way we can, although we don't have access to your account. Please let us know what information was provided once you receive a call back. We want to ensure this is resolved for you.

Joliz: You do know you have to follow me for me to DM you right? Otherwise I would've done it ages ago.

Amazon Support: I've enabled direct messaging, Joliz! Please don't include account sensitive information.

Alice: they put in a big metal monstrosity because people were stealing mail but now they put my amazon boxes in there they don't bring it up to my door.....which is why i order lucky's cat food from you...i was in an accident and don't want to carry boxes from the box to my door if i'm having this issue i'm sure other people are? thanks for looking into it.....again defeats the purpose of ordering things online they put this thing in front they leave my packages in...that is not my door.
Amazon Customer Care: Who is the carrier assigned to this delivery? Let us know, we'll be more than happy to assist!
Alice: you mean like the usps or ups or fedex? i'm not sure ...if i'm a prime member do they all ship one method?

Ray: Hello, yet again I am here for my appointment. No optician. Disgraceful. Second time.
Allyn: Hi Ray, I am very sorry about this. Did you discuss this with the Opticians manager?
Ray: I will if they ever get in. I was told 29mins 12 mins ago. Disgraceful.
Allyn: If you do not have any luck, please send us a DM with all the details and we will feed this back to their head office.
Ray: I've sent a DM after the same happened last week. Promised to be called. Never was. Sent another today. No response.
Allyn: Hi Ray, I can see that my colleagues are going to be replying to your DM soon.
Ray: I've sent DMs with details.
Rocsi: Hi Ray, please check your DMs. Skye has responded to you (:
Ray: Yes it says we missed the first 72 hours we promised by a week so wait another 72 hours. Not good enough is it? As timely as your opticians.
Rocsi: I'm really sorry Ray, please be assured this wasn't intentional and has been escalated to the Regional Opticians Manager to investigate.
Ray: I saw your optician arriving 20mins after my appointment time. Laid back strolling in late. No care for others' time. Should be laid off.
Laura: Hi Ray, as advised you'll receive a response within 72 hours. Many thanks.
