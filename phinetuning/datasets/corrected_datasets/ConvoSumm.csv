Carlos: Great advice! I'll keep that in mind. Do you have any must-see spots in Japan?

Emma: Definitely visit Kyoto for the temples and Tokyo for the buzz. Don't miss out on trying fresh sushi either!

Anna: That's a tough one. On one hand, platforms do contribute to stress and anxiety, but on the other hand, it's the users' choice to engage with it.

Paul: Hey everyone, I need some references on fonts and good web design for a friend working with Oxford Health Authority. I even checked Nielsen but couldn't find anything. Any ideas?

Ide: I usually go with sans serif or serif without more precision. It seems to me that we can preserve some design and at the same time allow the user to keep their preferences. Of course, with only relative font sizes. Can this cause accessibility problems?

Demon: Don't write off all the other great browsers out there just yet. The news of Gates' takeover of the internet is somewhat premature. In fact, nothing from Seattle is even in my computer. I usually browse via the public domain browser LYNX. 

Jamie: While I am all for creating accessible websites, I think the ability to use different fonts is an important aesthetic consideration in web design - though of course these should always be set as font-families with the default sans-serif as an option. As long as fonts are defined using CSS and sizes are defined at a reasonable size by ems or percentages, I can't see any reason to discard them for the bland uniformity of default fonts for everyone.

Andrew: Personally, I like Verdana as it's just a little wider than Arial - my vision impaired colleagues find it better too. This is supported by SitePoint. There are two fonts specifically designed for maximum readability on screen, Verdana and Georgia. The only downside is that they do not print out very well. Arial and Times Roman are both very legible both onscreen and off.

Denise: For what it's worth, Verdana (sans-serif) was designed for use on computers, and scales better than comparable fonts such as Arial. There was also some good recent font research posted on CHIWEB. I'll check with my usability specialist to see if it's still available online.

   Kynn: But I am not sure that single-design pages will be able to deliver optimal usability in the future. For example, screen sizes will soon differ so drastically between high-end office workstations and small mobile devices that the same pages will not satisfy both. How does access for cognitively impaired users tie into this? If content needs to be actually rewritten for a new audience in order to make it comprehensible, is this the end of writing once and the beginning of specialized websites for each type of disability? Your thoughts are welcome.
   Marti: In an ideal world everything would be accessible to everyone all the time. But we don't live in that world. Whether it is the web or any other media there will be some practical considerations in the development of material. I am sure a case can be made for extremes but is there really any serious need to produce a driver's handbook in Braille? Has anyone considered the needs of a cognitively disabled person who is also blind? If the ideal of Universal Design escapes us, we should, I think, adapt in the best way possible with the target audience in mind. Thus, that fancy high-end system at the office shouldn't be spending a lot of time in a games area and I would rather not think about somebody using a phone-link to review a scientific paper while driving to work.
   Kynn: A blind grandmother helping her granddaughter study for a driving test?
   Marti: Of course, as I said a case can be made for almost everything. It remains for society to decide if it is worth the investment (time, money, resources) to meet each and every individual need. In any culture, the answers are likely to be different. None of this should ever stop us from striving to achieve an ideal world.
   David: Should a child be able to make an atom bomb? Make sure they are easy to understand, complete with icons showing the proper order of assembly?
   Marti: I am certainly not disagreeing with Universal Design concepts, just having trouble with where and how to draw the lines.

The consensus seems to be that while Universal Design is a noble goal, practical limitations may require targeted adaptations for different users.

Charles: Is there anyone out there who can tell me whether I've got this right? As I understand it, braille is usually abbreviated, and there are different conventions for abbreviation depending on the language. In other words, there's French braille and German braille. If this is the case, is it possible that a sentence written in one language and contracted will appear logical in another language but have a different meaning? And if so, will this occur more than once in any person's lifetime?

Joe: Yes, you're correct that many languages abbreviate braille according to the specific letter groupings and pronunciations of that language. It's also true that the appropriate treatment of braille depends on the context. For instance, French braille in France differs from that in Quebec, which is different again from British or American variations. So, ambiguity is possible, but usually, the brain can sort out the context to understand the right meaning. In English braille, for example, the slash (/) and the letter-group ""st"" have the same braille representation.

Charles: That's fascinating. So does this mean current work in braille code design is aimed at removing such ambiguities?

Joe: Exactly! Work towards a Unified Braille Code (UBC) is in progress, focusing on minimizing these ambiguities, especially for technical notation. The International Council on English Braille is debating whether language switches should have an explicit signal in braille.

Lloyd: Joe's explanation is spot-on, especially considering his extensive experience in braille translation software. There's definitely potential for confusion in short sentences, but most people can figure things out. Also, contracted braille isn't typically encoded as HTML. In projects like WebBraille, we provide contracted braille material ready for embossing on braille devices.

Charles: Are ICEB, BANA, etc., involved with or aware of this WAI group?

Joe: Yes, both ICEB and BANA are aware of WAI and share its goal of promoting accessibility. Automatic braille rendering from the web and electronic sources is increasingly important, and UBC is part of this effort.

Mariana: Somebody told me it was fine to put the liquid on the fur around my cat's mouth, and she will lick it off. Is that okay?

Lena: If the medicine can be administered with a syringe (without a needle), the easiest method is actually sliding the syringe tip along the inside of the cheek, to the back of the mouth. Squirting the medication there will force the cat to swallow it.

João: No, as she would not take the complete dose that way. It’s easier if you trick her to open her mouth by showing her some of her favorite food, or open it yourself using a bit of quick force.

Amir: Most doses are too large for fur to be an effective dosage vector. If you're having trouble administering liquid medicines via syringe, ask your vet to coach you. You can also try giving treats afterward to help your cat get used to it.

Liv: My elderly cat takes his medicine mixed with food. We give him a small amount of food with the medicine first thing in the morning, so he eats it quickly.

Yuki: You could try training your cat to willingly drink from a syringe by using something tasty like the liquid from a tuna can. Praise them when they sniff or lick the syringe. Eventually, they'll get used to it, and you can sneak the medicine in.

Rajesh: What is the most appropriate way to answer ""Is this John?"" on the phone in American English?

Jennifer: Personally, I would avoid ""it is him"" and ""it is he"" if you're trying to stick to idiomatic American English. They aren't grammatically wrong, but you wouldn't normally hear someone speak of themselves this way on the phone. Your other choices are good ones. Another option is, ""This is John"" or ""Yes, this is John.""

Michael: The technically correct answer is ""This is he."" This is because the verb ""to be"" is used in a special form called the copula. With copulative verbs, no action is indicated – rather a state of being is indicated – and so the second substantive, called the predicate, doesn't take the objective case. But, ""This is him"" is also very common. Your hiring manager might be very particular about this or might not care at all. It’s easiest to avoid the problem by simply answering, ""Yes, this is John.""

Anna: ""He doesn’t"" sound like a good way of talking about oneself. I’d drop that one immediately. ""Yes"" sounds too short and impolite. ""Yes, John speaking"" and ""Yes, speaking"" both sound perfectly fine.

Kyle: Since you're looking for an answer to ""Is this John?"", this implies that you must have initially answered the phone with ""Hello."" This is the normal default telephone greeting in the US. If you're expecting an important call, just answer the phone with ""John Smith"" or ""This is John.""

Sophie: ""It is"" would be quite unusual.

David: ""Yes"" or ""Yes, speaking"" both work nicely. There might be particular conventions depending on the country, but to my ear, both sound fine.

Liam: It might be grammatically completely wrong but idiomatic here in Scotland. Another answer I often hear is ""Speaking.""

Gina: A lot of jeans have zippers that open on their own. For me, it is quite uncomfortable to be re-zipping them in the middle of the street. What can I do to prevent this?

Raj: A thing I have found is to get a key ring, large enough to be able to pass through the jeans' button. What I did was to pass it through the zipper-hook. Zip the zipper all the way up and hook the ring through the jeans' button.

Anna: In-built lock. It's already there on your zip. Most jeans zippers now come with an in-built lock. When you zip just make sure that the zip-hook is placed vertically down; this will lock the zip. Just try to open the zip with the hook placed down, it won't open. Some low-quality jeans might not use properly produced zips though.

Hiro: Two solutions, with some top-notch drawing (I'm clearly the next Vincent Van Gogh). Tie a thin piece of string through the hole at the top of your zipper and your belt. However, have the string go through the inside of your pants, then out from the top of your pants, and tied to your belt. Put tape on the inside of your pants where it's not visible and use this tape to hold the zipper in place.

Linda: I sometimes use a paperclip, passing it through the hole in the zipper and trying to attach it to the jeans' fabric. This requires testing until you find something that works for you.

Carlos: You could avoid the need to constantly rezip jeans by sidestepping the problem entirely. I only wear button/rivet fly jeans for this exact reason. All major manufacturers of jeans provide these designs.

Elena: Shevliaskovic’s answer is classic, but I have a couple more to add. Hairspray—spray it on the zipper. It makes it stickier or something. It works for a while, but you’ll have to reapply every so often. Also, get a pair of pliers, preferably needle-nosed, and squeeze each side of the zip mechanism gently to tighten its grip on the teeth. This is delicate work because you can easily break the zip doing this.

Peter: If your pants button and the zipper are magnetic, you might want to magnetize both by swiping them with a strong magnet around 100 times. This will cause them to stick to each other but can still be removed when you pull on them.

Sophia: Use a common safety pin. The very end of your zipper pull has a tiny hole. Use a safety pin through that hole and the cloth of the zipper to hold your zipper closed.

Ahmed: I missed my suhoor this morning. Do I still have to fast?

Sara: Eating suhoor is sunnah, not obligatory. Prophet Muhammad said to eat suhoor, but fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for every Muslim.

Ahmed: So even if I missed suhoor, I should continue the fast?

Ali: Yes, you have to fast. Suhoor is not a pre-requisite. It's a sunnah, meaning there's blessing in it, but it's not obligatory.

Zara: Exactly, fasting has certain conditions like being Muslim, beyond puberty, in a sound state of mind, and not being sick or traveling. Suhoor isn't one of those conditions.

Ahmed: That's helpful. So making the intention to fast is more important?

Lina: Yes, you need to make the intention for fasting. The intention can be made anytime after sunset until midday. Even if made before midday, the fast is valid.

Hassan: And remember to recite durood shareef before and after making the intention. Suhoor is highly recommended but not compulsory for fasting.

Fatima: Many people don't take suhoor when the fasting time is short and eating time is long. The Prophet said there's blessing in suhoor, but you can still fast if you miss it.

Omar: Surah Al-Baqarah also says you can eat until fajr and then have to fast until Maghrib. Missing suhoor doesn’t spoil your fast or give you permission to eat after fajr.

				Liam: I recently upgraded to puncture-resistant tires on my road bike. The previous tires are old but still usable. Is there any value to doing anything other than throwing them out? For instance, is there any reason to keep them? Is it possible to sell used tires? If no one wants them, can/should they be recycled?
				Ethan: I usually gift them to people who need them. I use rather expensive tires and prefer them in mint condition. So, after a couple of months, I'll most probably change them. The old tires can still give 6-12 months of quality riding time to someone. I'll post on local riding forums with close-up photos of the tread, and usually, people will get them.
				Olivia: You could use your old tires for when you are on the trainer and your new tires for road riding. That way, your trainer won’t wear out your new tires.
				Emma: New tires are puncture-resistant, not proof. I keep old tires as a quick fix for such situations until I can buy new ones. I also frequently go to the cottage house with my bike, so I keep one old spare tire there.
				Noah: Tyres have steel or aramid beads in the edge. If you cut that off with workshop snips, it becomes a ~2 meter long flat length as opposed to a hoop. This flattened tread can be used for packing/padding things, and protecting things. Have also tried to make some rubber tyres for our council wheelie bins because they're horribly loud when rolled.
				Ava: In case your idea of tire reuse goes beyond reusing them on a bike, you can turn them into fashion accessories like belts, bags, wallets, or even waterproof tool rolls. Local bike shops or car tire shops might also accept them for recycling.

Joshua: If I recall my time in the scouts well enough, I'd suggest the following: a set of screwdrivers, an 8-10oz hammer, a set of pliers, a small chunk from a bar of cheap soap for coating screw threads, a piece of chalk for marking things and absorbing moisture, a small framing square, and a retractable tape rule. If you shop around and hit discount stores, it's not an expensive proposition.

Emily: Magnetic stud finder is a great idea (many uses and kids love playing with it - and educational). Don’t forget gloves, safety glasses, and a little set of screwdrivers with mini pliers. Kids have toys they can try to fix and will need smaller tools to start with.

David: At around that age, I got a premade toolbox from a store for real cheap. It included a hammer, combo wire cutter/stripper/crimper, level, ratcheting screwdriver with various bits, miniature screwdriver set, adjustable wrench, assorted wire connectors, and an Exacto knife. It was almost everything I needed at that age, besides a soldering iron and related equipment.

Sophia: I would add a small spirit level and maybe a cheap adjustable wrench too.

Michael: And get some spares or loners so that no one is left without them. Nails hardly ever hit the hammerer but often squirt sideways and get the kid sharing the workbench. If this is just for carpentry, consider a pencil, a ruler (which can be made by just sticking marks on a stick), and a short saw. 

Rebecca: Actually useful tools are the ones that are well-made, even if they’re expensive. It's not very fun when the handle breaks; cheap tools can be dangerous. They might own some of these tools for the rest of their lives. I'd suggest a minimalist approach to mitigate budget concerns. They need a hammer with a secure head, needle nose and slip-joint pliers, a quality tape measure, and screwdrivers. An adjustable wrench would be nice but not crucial.

Stansted: 1 hour 30 to 1 hour 48; London City: 59 min to 1 hour 20, depending on the time of day. From personal experience, avoid Stansted and Luton, and not many fly into London City. So, I'd be looking at Gatwick or Heathrow, mainly.

Michael: Geographically, of the major London airports, Heathrow seems to be closest. If you plan to take a cab or rent a car, then Heathrow is probably the best, followed by Stansted and Luton. If you want to travel by car, I would avoid Gatwick (other side of London) and London City (as the name suggests, in the city centre) airports. On the other hand, if you plan to travel by public transport, then distance often bears little relationship to travel time. Busses are slow, and trains tend to go to/from central London. Neither of the Harrow rail stations is on the same rail line as any of the airports. Heathrow still seems to be the best, but after that, it's a wash in terms of travel time (though probably not travel cost) between City, Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton.

Sarah: Mark provided a good factual answer about London's airports, and David added a couple of good subjective points (cheaper flights, time convenience, etc.). I would add that, from personal experience, if you are planning to travel by car, then Luton or Heathrow would be best, as they are roughly the same distance from Harrow, and you'd be travelling through roughly the same volumes of traffic (possibly, a bit less traffic from Luton). If you are planning on using public transport, then I would recommend Heathrow, as it's much better connected, with a variety of public transport options, and you can get from Heathrow to Harrow on the Hill using only tube and public bus. Have a look at Google Map options and note that on the Piccadilly line, you can switch at Acton Town station, no need to go to Hammersmith - this would save you another 10 minutes or so.

John: As Mark's answer shows, except for Stansted, the travel times from the major London airports to Harrow are basically the same. The differences between them aren't significant compared to other aspects of your journey. For example, flying at a time that's more convenient for you, picking a cheaper flight, or a route with better connections would probably all make a bigger difference than the possibility of saving 15 minutes travelling from the airport to Harrow.

Anna: If you are looking for a nearby airport, then Northolt Airport is just 5 miles away from Harrow. If you are looking for an airport that is easily reachable by public transport, then London Heathrow Airport is the best.

Lina: I heard that having a fire in a cave or under an overhang could cause rocks to collapse and it could be really dangerous. Is that true?

Ali: Is it a real risk? I think it's higher with softer rocks like sandstone since they can crack and break due to heat. With granite, the risk might be lower, but I wouldn't risk it unless the cave is large and well ventilated.

Jasper: Another problem is that the smoke from the fire can affect cave-dwelling species, particularly bats. In winter, the smoke and warm air can wake them up and drive them out, leading them to freeze or starve to death.

Monica: The rule of thumb is that the rock shouldn’t get hot. Heating the rock makes water inside evaporate, which can cause cracks. If you’re just using the fire to warm yourself or cook modestly, it should be okay. Just make sure it’s a moderate fire so the rock doesn’t even get warm. And definitely avoid throwing bigger stones into the fire—they can explode.

Kyle: I once lit a fire in a cave and we had to evacuate because of the smoke and a swarm of spiders dropping from the ceiling! It wasn’t dangerous for me in the UK since we don't have deadly spiders, but elsewhere, it could be a significant danger. Instead, consider using a reflector fire to bounce the heat inside the cave and funnel the smoke across the cave mouth.

Aria: Initially, I thought the danger sounded like an urban myth. Then I read about a sad story from 2009: A 16-year-old boy was crushed to death by falling stones in a cave, probably unsettled by the heat from his campfire. A geology expert confirmed that a pre-existing weakness in the cave combined with the heat to cause around 200kg of rock to fall.

Miguel: I don't know how to phrase my question better, but I just want to know if there will be any little difference if I directly replace one with the other.

Sophia: I think we can generally divide them like this, although the separation may not always be so clear. To study is the action, the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject. To learn is the result of that action, gaining or acquiring knowledge or skill by study, experience, or being taught.

James: Well, you can study without learning, but you can't often learn without studying, at least in academic subjects. Saying ""I studied English"" means you took classes in English. It does not necessarily mean you learned anything. Saying ""I learned how to tie a clove hitch"" means you actually acquired a useful skill.

Anita: To learn is a much broader term than to study. I agree that learning is a result, but it is most often a result of no conscious action on our part. We learn from the moment we exist, taking in the lore of language and customs of those around us through all of our senses. We learn every moment of our lives, even while sleeping. When we study, we make a conscious effort to learn a specific lore. Learning is always the result, even if what we learn is that we can't make heads nor tails of what we are studying. But learning is a given whether we study or not.

Liam: Learning is gaining knowledge. Studying is pursuing knowledge.

Claire: In my case, just because I studied chemistry in high school does not mean I learned it.

Alyssa: I consider the difference more than subtle. You can study without learning and, yes, you can learn without studying. Studying is the act of trying to gain information. It generally results in learning. Learning is acquiring new information. It can result from study, but also from everyday life and experiences.

Alex: They are very distinct - study implies some kind of focus, while learning can happen by perhaps a broader mechanism. Usage would depend upon context. Study also can be a verb or a noun, so that might influence using or avoiding it depending upon context. For what it's worth, the term study is not used, for example, when discussing work towards degrees in England (at Oxford or Cambridge) - in that case, the term used is read, as in ""I read Maths at Cambridge,"" or ""What is Sally reading at Oxford?""

Emma: To study doesn't necessarily mean you'll learn anything. For example, in High School, I was required to study History, and it was very boring and I had trouble paying attention, therefore I did not learn anything.

  Rachel: I'm trying to say that a certain individual adds noise to any place he goes. When someone, figuratively, enhances the mood of a room he enters, we say he lights up the room. Is there any way to use sound as a verb to get the same idea across but with sound?
  
  Jordan: Actually, he brightens up a room or *he lights up a room* would most likely include sound since he is not a light source but rather a live, animated presence.
  
  Emily: One particular form of adding sound is ""chatting up."" To engage someone in light, casual talk: He would be chatting up folks from Kansas. You might also say ""regale"" to entertain or amuse someone with talk; he regaled her with a colorful account of that afternoon's meeting. Or you could say ""He lilted through the room,"" which means to sing or play in a lively cheerful manner.
  
  David: The intransitive verb form of ""noise"" means to talk much or loudly. By analogy with ""lights up a room,"" you could say that someone ""noises up a room.""
  
  Sandra: Sound would bring in connotations of testing out the feeling of the room, as, say, a comedian might, related to the nautical ""sounding"" meaning to test the depth of the water so you don't run aground. One could ""sound out a room"" in this sense. ""Sound up a room"" just sounds odd, and few people would have any idea what you meant.
  
  Monica: When you say ""add noise,"" I'm assuming you mean this in a negative light. Instead of telling compelling stories that hold people in rapt attention, the person is loud and boisterous, perhaps uncouth. He clamors for attention wherever he goes. ""Clamor"" is defined as to shout or talk loudly. He adds din to the room wherever he goes. You could also say, ""He adds commotion to the room wherever he goes."" It's not a verb, but it might be the most accurate way to describe his boorish social skills.
  
  Michael: ""Fill the room with sound"" is how it would be used. You can ""quiet down"" a sound, like a teacher telling students to ""quiet down."" You could ""lift up"" a sound, as in ""lift up your voice."" You could ""sound a trumpet"" which would fill up the room with noise. Then maybe you could ""sound a choir"" in the same way, though I haven't heard it used that way. You can ""sound an alarm,"" and this would be a verb.

Elena: I always bring a large kitchen trash bag in my suitcase when I travel. At the end of each day, I put my dirty clothes in the trash bag and close it, if it has a drawstring. When I re-pack my suitcase to go home at the end of the trip, I put any clean clothes in the bottom of the suitcase, then put the closed trash bag full of dirty clothes on top of it. The plastic trash bag keeps the clean clothes from getting dirty, and it also helps me unpack quickly at home. I just take the bag out and empty it right into my laundry hamper.

David: Get a suitcase with a zip cover on each side. The clothes get put in the dirty side once you've worn them. They stay separate unless you forget to zip one side up before you close it, of course.

Priya: I use separate ziplock bags for smelly/dirty clothing, for used but can be used again, and for small items of clothing that tend to get lost between the bigger items. When you do your laundry while traveling, you fold the bags and store them till you get the same level of dirt again. Instead of ziplock bags, you can also use the thin nylon shopping bags or wash bags which are quite easy to get these days.

Carlos: Use a cloth bag so the clothes can breathe. If you use a plastic bag, they'll be a bit icky after a few days. If you have one with handles or a drawstring, you can hang it up tidily. Those cloth shopping bags are good for this. If you don't have a cloth bag handy, use a pillowcase, or a used T-shirt.

Sofia: Nylon bags are really good, especially for humid climates. I used plastic bags in Thailand and got actual mold on my dirty laundry. Then switched to nylon bags and solved this. Also, many hotels have free nylon laundry bags. Plastic trash bags work well in dry climates.

Alex: I notice I tend to rest the little finger of my picking hand on the body of my guitar, typically on the edge of the sound-hole, for greater accuracy and steadiness of the picking hand. After extended periods of time, this finger can start to ache, which makes me wonder if using it like this can cause injury in the long-term. Is it ideal to use this finger like this or not?

Erik: I don't think there's an ideal or not ideal. It can be a good technique for accuracy, but you lose speed. It is worthwhile having as another technique in your arsenal. I use it a lot and I think practice will make it less of a strain for you, but you will also find that you can improve your free hand accuracy over time anyway.

Marta: I find that anchoring my hand like this limits my range of motion to an unacceptable degree, so I try to avoid it.

Lucas: I had a teacher who told me to do this and at the time it was great. I wasn't getting into very advanced playing, so I didn't need that extra mobility. There's nothing wrong with doing it, but you won't always want to because it does limit your mobility in your picking hand. Also, if it's causing any pain, you really shouldn't do it. It won't go away, and it could cause long-term injury. You should either find a different way of anchoring your pinky or stop doing it altogether.

Sara: There are those who maintain you shouldn't and others who do it all the time. I do so if I'm Travis picking, seems to help with accuracy. However, not when I'm playing jazzy complex chords as I use more fingers... And never when flatpicking.

Jonas: Actually, this is not a very good technique. You are not supposed to rest your finger. If you watch famous guitarists, you'll probably see that they follow this technique, but they only use it while performing, and, I guess, without noticing it. For example, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, John Frusciante, etc. But of course, you know you are not Jimi Hendrix, and even these players, I believe, try to avoid resting the little finger while they practice. If you want to check what's the best technique, you should definitely see videos of great Jazz players, who usually have an excellent technique even while performing.

Liam: Maybe you should, maybe you shouldn't. I personally tried to do this but didn't find it helpful. If someday you find yourself really uncomfortable doing it, you'll just stop. In fact, people tend to overstate the power of habit: it's not like it will take you years to stop doing it. While it helps you, stick with it.

Eva: When I first started to learn, the default seemed to be to place the little finger to anchor. As I progressed I found that naturally I was actually doing it less and less. What I would say was that it did help in the beginning as it encourages your muscle memory for where the strings are.

Luis: I've seen trees with the lower trunks painted white in a number of places around the world but have never found a definite answer to why this is done. Does anybody know why you would paint part of a tree white?

Emily: In ""The Garden Primer,"" they say it's to prevent apple borers from tunneling into the trunk. Painting it with white latex paint makes it easier to spot the sawdust residue the larvae produce.

Oliver: It's also to protect younger tree trunks from winter sun and wind. You can either wrap them or paint them with white paint to prevent sunscald.

Nina: When trees are painted white at the bottom, it's called whitewashing. It helps reduce reinfestation of borers and can prevent secondary fungal infection caused by insects.

Antonio: I've seen this a lot in Arizona, especially on citrus trees. The white paint protects the young bark from the sun until the canopy of leaves provides enough shade.

Sophia: My mom used to 'whitewash' our trees in Kentucky in the spring to keep bugs away. The trees looked really pretty in the summer after being painted.

Matthias: In Germany, they use white markers on trees along roads to prevent cars from crashing into them. In other places, color marking trees means they are to be felled.

Hanna: Use a flat latex white paint. It helps keep the tree cooler and deters bugs. There are specific tree trunk white paints that preserve trees too.

Karol: In Poland, this is often done in late winter to prevent sunscald.

Asha: In Guyana, this is done for beautification. It makes the place look bright and beautiful.

You need some elasticated cord (often called shock cord) and some cord locks of an appropriate size for the diameter of the shock cord you have. Thread this through a strap or some webbing on the bag and use the cord locks to make a size-adjustable retaining loop. Alternatively, you can use shaped pieces of wood or plastic as toggles through the helmet's vents.

Thomas: I just use the strap with its own clip. It does swing around though. Some bags have an elastic net that works very well. Maybe you can get the carabiner through both sides of the strap? Replacing the carabiner with a tighter strap might be a good compromise.

Megan: Stick on or sew on a Velcro fastener on the strap close to the helmet and on a suitable part of the backpack. You could also use an industrial-size press stud fastener. Hopefully, you don't carry the helmet on your backpack while riding.

Ethan: I would suggest trying to clip the helmet chin strap around both backpack shoulder straps or, if the backpack isn't too big, around the whole backpack. There's also the option of using a rubber strap with hooks to fasten your helmet. Personally, I find it faster to hang it around the stem and handlebars for quick access compared to detaching it from the backpack.

Olivia: My backpack has a dedicated helmet holding piece, but I don't use it because it requires adjusting six adjustment straps. Instead, for longer climbs, I clip the chin strap under both of the top cover straps which keeps the helmet mostly in place. For short climbs or when going into a shop, I clip the shoulder strap to the plastic ring on the backpack's shoulder strap, making it easier to put on and take off without stopping.

Laura: I understand that newborn's immune system is still weak and crowds or strangers should be avoided. But how soon can I take my newborn outside? Like for an hour's walk in a non-crowded park? Any particular things to pay attention to?

Emily: This pamphlet from the South Carolina Department of Health says it's safe at one month. Avoid large crowds, but the fresh air is good for the baby. Just avoid people touching your baby's hands since they might put them in their mouth. Also, dress the baby appropriately for the weather and avoid too much sun exposure. Personally, I'd take the baby for a walk as soon as I felt up to it, usually within days of birth.

Jack: Our pediatricians advised us to avoid anyone with easily transmittable diseases for the first six weeks. The main reason is you don't know who might be contagious. We took our daughter for short walks in the woods when she was a week old. It was more beneficial for me to get some fresh air, but as long as the baby is comfortable and protected, you can take her out.

Sarah: I've never heard that strangers should be avoided with newborns, and I wouldn't recommend staying inside. You need to get out for your sanity. Exposure to new environments is good for babies. Just avoid sick people, but don't go overboard.

Michael: Someone asked this in our new parents' group. The answer was, ""You already took your baby outside when you went home from the hospital. Find something else to worry about."" Handling by strangers is another story, but being outside with the right clothing and sun protection doesn't seem to be an issue.

Isabella: We took our newborn to a crowded shopping center at 3 days old. We were very careful, but nothing happened. She grew up fine. Be cautious as their immune system isn't at full strength yet, but they don't need to be cocooned either.

Yuki: Here in Asia, it's common to wait until babies are 3 months old before taking them out. We followed that tradition, and our child did well. The conservative approach works for us, especially with concerns about asymptomatic diseases. But we had friends and family over during those first three months.

Lucas: For us, it really depended on the weather. We live in the North of France, so it's freezing in winter. We didn't go out much with our newborn until he was 2-3 months old. But our daughter was born in summer, so after a few weeks, we started going out more progressively.

Anna: My wife and I went for a walk on the 3rd day in the hospital park. As long as the baby is wrapped properly to stay warm, everything is fine. Our hospital even provided the buggy and a little jacket for us.

Johanna: I'm currently living in Switzerland. It's known for being an attractive location for companies, and there are quite a few American companies in Zurich. Living in Zurich is really expensive, like in London, but people still choose to live here. Salaries are high, but companies keep coming. Why is that?

Stefan: The cost of living is pretty high in New York City too. It has the highest Consumer Price Index of any U.S. city, and salaries tend to be highest there as well. But people deal with all the hassles of living in NYC because it offers so much activity. I bet the advantages are similar in Zurich: job opportunities, business opportunities, and lifestyle options.

Nina: In addition to what Stefan said, there are definitely other benefits in Switzerland: political stability, great location, lots of well-educated people, low crime and corruption, and access to money.

Thomas: Switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights, although that's recently changed with banks having to turn over account holder names to the U.S. government. Another appealing aspect is Switzerland's neutral policy. The government doesn't deploy the military globally, so there's no worry about payback from such actions. 

Martina: Also, Switzerland has a beautiful landscape, low crime rate, and hasn't been invaded for a couple of hundred years. It's close to major cultural centers and includes many of its own. Not everything is about money.

Hans: The lake is beautiful and Swiss people are well-educated, which is attractive to companies. We have low taxes, political stability, a stable currency, and a company-friendly environment.

Luca: Big companies find Switzerland to be business-friendly and often benefit from special tax regimes. But don't confuse the interests of companies with personal benefits.

Karl: For some context, here are unemployment figures for Switzerland and surrounding countries: Liechtenstein at 2.3%, Switzerland at 3.5%, Germany at 4.5%, Austria at 5.6%, France at 10.8%, and Italy at 11.5%. Liechtenstein has a small job market, while Germany's figure is the lowest it's been in decades. I'd expect Switzerland's unemployment to stay constant, making it easier to find a job here.

Rachel: Have you ever wondered why the Observers in Fringe always eat really spicy food?

Alex: I think it's because they're portrayed as being emotionless and somewhat disconnected from reality. They don't seem to experience time in a linear way either.

Mira: But we've seen incidents where they do show some emotion. Like when August fell in love with Christine Hollis and how September has an emotional attachment to Walter. Maybe they can only taste spicy food because it's the only sensation they can feel?

David: I came across something interesting. In episode 4 of season 1, Walter offers root beer to the Observer, but he declines saying he could hardly taste it. So, the spicy food thing might be because it's all they can taste.

Sarah: According to the Fringe Wiki, they have technology that allows them to control their own evolution. This technology enhances rational thinking by forming new ridges in the brain but destroys emotion centers, which also affects their sense of taste. They might only eat spicy foods because that's the only way they can feel what they are eating.

Kevin: Capsaicin, the spicy component, forms a nerve barrier and blocks sensation. If the Observers are always eating spicy food, their taste buds might be blocked by the capsaicin, making them unable to taste anything unless it's spicy.

Emily: I read that in their quest to become more advanced, they reacquired some reptilian traits. Reptiles typically have few or no taste buds. Maybe their diminished sense of taste comes from this reptilian side, and they react to spicy food through cranial nerve irritation instead.

Patrick: I constantly lose my keys, phone, and wallet. I tend to leave them inside the car, house, bathroom, and public places. It costs me a lot of valuable time and increases my stress levels. Do you have any tips on keeping my valuables in check? 

Linda: Have you tried putting your phone on a leash? Tether all your stuff to your belt loop and you won't be leaving it everywhere. 

Kevin: Personally, I mentally recite the mantra ""wallet, phone, keys"" about a dozen times a day, while tapping the relevant pocket. Eventually, the mantra becomes a single block that you recall in its entirety rather than a list of items to be remembered individually. Combined with the tapping, you learn to recognize both patterns and notice if you're missing an item.

Emily: I used to have this problem in the morning when getting ready. I'd carry my phone until the first point I needed both hands and put it down somewhere. I started making a conscious effort to put my phone in a specific place every morning. It felt unnatural at first, but now it's a habit and I rarely lose my phone.

James: This is probably a focus and habit issue as opposed to forgetfulness. Try doing one thing at a time and extend the boundaries of your start/finish areas. For example, the start of driving to work isn't when you get in the car but everything leading up to it. Build habits by marking off a calendar when you remember your keys/wallet/phone and aim to not break the habit chain!

Mark: Here's a hack that might work. I keep a $20 bill in my car. If I misplace any items, the next day I hand the $20 bill to the first stranger I meet. It motivates me to remember my stuff! I also use Lookout on my phone.

Emily: I searched Thesaurus but found nothing. Example sentence: The __ were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured.

James: Fare, as described at dictionary.com, is a slightly older word, but you will still find it at many restaurants. Note that fare is a singular, collective noun. For example, ""The fare was top quality, just like the restaurant review assured.""

Sophie: The words comestibles, victuals, provisions, and foodstuffs are occasionally used in a generic sense to mean things providing nourishment, including both food and drink. They certainly aren't common words though, and probably aren't perfect for your sentence. If you absolutely have to use a single word, the first two are, in my opinion, most suitable, although they may be considered rather old-fashioned and pretentious.

Liam: There isn't really a single word in regular usage that covers food and drink combined. ""Food and beverages"" is probably the most common term in the hotel trade. However, outside the trade, the expression ""food and drink"" is much more widely used. Note that when used in this expression, drink is normally considered a collective term, so it is not plural. The plural can also be used, but it is less common.

Mia: Offerings is a commercial term occasionally seen in marketing verbiage. Dictionary.com defines offerings as something presented for inspection or sale. For example, ""The offerings were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured."" Using any other food or meal term simply feels forced and overly encompassing.

Ethan: If the food and drink isn't the primary reason for being where they are served, you could say refreshments.

Ava: For the sentence and context in the question, I'd simply go with meal or food. The drink part of a restaurant meal is usually secondary unless you're a bit of a wine connoisseur.

Noah: Although it doesn't always refer to food and drink, I think the most natural word to insert in your example sentence is selections: ""The selections were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured."" It’s obviously food because we're talking about a restaurant.

                        Ana: I would have said that the link was an onomatopoeic one. It is based entirely on the closeness of sound, as opposed to meaning. Onomatopoeia is defined as 'the formation of a word from a sound associated with what it is named'. Usually that 'sound' is a natural sound, like cuckoo or sizzle. But I see no reason why it shouldn't be another word, especially one in a different language. Based on meaning, I suppose in France he might be known as Guillaume Portes.

                        Alex: If you are interested in a private language answer: my family would say, ""That's very Mots d'Heures,"" after the brilliant book written by Luis D'Antin Van Rooten.

                        Maria: If the first term makes you think of the second term, you could describe it as evocative, bringing thoughts, memories, or feelings into the mind, according to Merriam-Webster.

                        Peter: If your brain votes for things, then you are using free association. The method of free association has no linear or preplanned agenda but works by intuitive leaps and linkages which may lead to new personal insights and meanings. In my reverie, I free-associated Bill Gates, and my subconscious came up with Guillaume Gateaux.

                        Sophie: Faux amis or false cognates might be applicable. This expression applies to words whose similarity lies only in their structure, sound, and/or letter sequences. My French mum always uses it when people try really direct translations that result in real French/English words having meanings completely different from that intended.

                        Tom: A malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, often humorous utterance. An example is Yogi Berra's statement: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes."" More examples include Archie Bunker calling Orthodox Jews ""off-the-docks"" Jews, referring to the Women's Lubrication Movement rather than Liberation, and ""Peach 'n cake"" instead of ""Piece of Cake.""

Raj: I've recently developed a shellfish allergy, and I'm not sure what the best substitute for oyster sauce would be. I've read that the flavor of it is not really easily substitutable. What is the best way to substitute the flavor without inducing an allergic reaction?

Ming: The most widely-accepted substitute seems to be various sauces made from mushrooms. If you go to a specialty Asian food store, you might actually find a product called vegetarian oyster sauce, which is pretty much the same thing. Failing that, you can always substitute soy sauce, or hoisin sauce if you want a less watery texture. They won't be exactly the same, but it's the same general idea—dark, fermented, salty sauce rich in glutamates. 

Aisha: Try black bean sauce. The body and color of the sauce are similar, though there are coarse bits of beans in it, whereas oyster sauce is usually smooth. Add a shake of fish sauce to taste. Fish sauce alone may be too thin. Most fish sauces are fermented anchovies with added salt and maybe sugar. I just taste-tested this and found it to be a good substitute.

Emma: My grandmother makes vegetarian egg rolls for me. She uses a vegetarian oyster sauce you can find at pretty much any Asian food store. It tastes the same as the original sauce.

Luis: I have a recipe with frozen cooked black beans, sugar, miso soup paste, balsamic vinegar syrup. It's as close as I'll get with what's on hand.

Sophia: A mixture of Hoisin and fish sauce will be close to what you seek. Fish sauce is very thin and watery, whereas Hoisin sauce is thick, yet sweeter than oyster sauce.

Zara: I Heart Umami has a great vegetarian oyster sauce made with shiitake and dates. The sauce tastes really umami-rich and I love that it has no additives and is easy to make.

Jin: I would use a combination of light and dark soy, and perhaps a little sugar to bring back the sweetness.

Olivia: There's a recipe I use for Chinese greens in garlic sauce. It lacks some of the fishy complexity, but it is very close to oyster sauce. Basically, you fry chopped garlic in neutral oil until just off turning golden, add dark fermented soy and sugar, and thicken with cornstarch before tossing with steamed vegetables.

Ethan: There are several oyster sauce substitutes that are shell-fish free. Soy sauce is probably your best choice since the two sauces have similar tastes. Adding Worcestershire sauce usually gets rid of any distinguishable differences and it's shellfish free! Another option is mushroom sauce, which is vegetarian and super easy to make yourself.

Aki: I am allergic to mollusks and shellfish too but use Thai fish sauce with no problems. If you're at the beginning of your allergy, you can still try this. Do not use Indonesian shrimp paste, it will trigger a reaction for sure. I've been allergic for over ten years now and get a reaction from even slight bits of shellfish, but fish sauce is okay.

Religious Contexts,"<BEGIN CONVERSATION>
Jennifer: In the Event Horizon movie, the crew figures out the ship has been to Hell. But I'm curious; does it go to Hell in a biblical sense, or does it visit something more akin to the universe the Cenobites come from?

Michael: The ship travels by using a black hole to create a wormhole, but instead of Proxima Centauri, the wormhole led to an alternate dimension, a dimension of pure chaos, pure evil. So I suppose whether that qualifies as the hell from the Bible depends on your interpretation. I don't recall any of the flashbacks including the torment of long-dead souls, so I'd suggest that no, it's not the biblical hell, just a terrible place.

Emily: Well, there was a scene that didn't make it in, and in that scene Miller's not actually fighting Weir; he's fighting the entity that came back with the ship. Miller asks it if it is the devil, and the entity tells him he's not the devil but the darkness behind the stars and that it had been around since before the Big Bang, so no, it's not Hell.

David: But wherever the place is that the ship visits, it looks an awful lot like the things HP Lovecraft dreamt up. Also, Deadites are from the Raimi movies, it was Cenobites in the Hellbound Heart.

Samantha: Although the script is relatively vague, there's enough contextual clues to make a reasonable assumption that the ship was actually in Hell. The distress call literally translates as ""From Hell."" Justin states that he's been in ""The other place,"" and they have ""Visions from Hell.""

Brian: The original captain of the Event Horizon, after gouging his own eyes out, speaks a warning in Latin. Perhaps, then, the most relevant question is whether he or any member of the original crew knew Latin before they turned the experimental hyperdrive on. It stands to reason that if no one on the crew ever learned this language before the incident, it must have been taught to the captain by someone or something other than a crewmember after the activation of the drive. Since literal Biblical demons are frequently depicted as speaking Latin in modern media, this would be evidence in favor of the Event Horizon having passed through the literal Biblical Hell, rather than merely some unpleasant alien dimension. In short, who taught the captain Latin? Was it a demon?
