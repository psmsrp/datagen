Stacy: Hello, if my flight boards at 7:20 how early do I have to be there to check luggage I think I may be out of luck.
TJH: Hi, Stacy. You need to be at the airport at least 2 hours prior to departure.
Stacy: I'm on DL 2641 and I'm going to miss my flight due to traffic can you help to get me rescheduled on the next flight?
TJH: I'll be able to do confirm on DL2572, which is scheduled to leave at 9:00 AM for $75.
Stacy: I'm still in stand still traffic and I'm afraid I will miss that one too. Can you confirm on the next flight? The fee is fine.
TJH: Oh, no! There is one at 10:00, 11:21 or at 12:27, which one would work better for you?
Stacy: I know ... crazy..1121 is probably the safest bet the way this morning is going. Thank you for all of your help TJH! Delta always is so helpful.
TJH: You're most welcome. Please DM your phone number. I'd be glad to give you a call and set it up for you.
Stacy: I sent it .. please let me know if you didn't get it. Thanks again.

Lucinda: Absolutely appalled by the fact that Tesco don't believe that 90% girls shoes and 10% boys is not sexism! Are boys not entitled to dry warm feet same as girls? If not why not?!

Marian: Hi Lucinda, I'm sorry you feel this has been represented and for any upset this has caused. Can you please DM your name, email address, and local store so I can log your feedback? Thanks.

Lucinda: The manager said it was an HQ issue not store so please explain?! Everything from the brown shoes on the left to the far right are girls. Please explain why? Boys need to wear shoes too!

Calum: I apologise if this looks in any way prejudiced but I assure you we are just trying to do the best for our customers. Thanks. Hi Lucinda. I'm sorry you feel this way, I appreciate your frustration. We flex our space, and range, to support customer needs and perennial trends. We manage stock to each store to ensure we are giving a balanced offer.

Lucinda: So you're saying girls needed a choice of over 10 boots and 8 trainers and 10 shoes, boys only need one pair of boots and no shoes or trainers? Because that's what you're advertising. It is sexism and appalling of you to do this! Boys require clothes and choice just as much as girls! It in no way is balanced! Please provide me details to take this issue further? I cannot believe your bias to girls over boys. No explanation other than your wish for money! No thought to customers at all! 50% of kids are boys STOP DISCRIMINATING on sex!

Lucinda: Claiming 1 choice of trainer and boot for boys is balanced against over 10 choices of each for girls! How is that not discrimination and sexism? Boys not allowed choice cause they're boys?!

Calum: Hi Lucinda. I assure you this is not discriminating. There is just a much higher demand for female footwear than male footwear in our stores. Due to this big difference in demand we offer more female footwear as that is what our customers are more interested in investing in. This decision is down to our customers choices, and we try to change and improve to our customers needs and wants. Thanks.

Natasha: Hello, assuming the 16:03 Bristol Parkway - London Paddington can't be held?? On the delayed 15:41 BTM - Parkway, currently due into parkway 11 mins late at 16:03. Never mind, getting more & more delayed now. Seriously hate the trains. Given myself 2 hours spare to get to my final destination & now looking unlikely that'll be enough time.

Lewis: Hi Natasha. Sorry for the delay. The 15:41 service was delayed due to following a late running preceding service. Apologies for the problems this has caused. The next train to London Paddington us at 16:33.

Natasha: Ok, so due into London 40 mins later than planned (assuming we aren't delayed further...🙃), as the 16:33 takes 10 mins longer than the 16:03. At what point does this journey qualify for a refund (partial or otherwise)? So stressed.

Lewis: If delayed by an hour on that journey you can claim compensation.

Natasha: Beginning to look likely. Any idea when the signal problems will be fixed - currently stuck at Didcot Parkway with no departure est. Signal issues are so common in this area I've lost track of how often I've been delayed here.

Lewis: That service is currently expected to reach Paddington at 18:37. Apologies again for the delay.

Natasha: Finally arrived nearly 1hr 30mins late due to delays. Assume I can't claim as the delays were split on 2 trains? Going to miss the first half of the show I'm due to see. Overall a great Friday 🙁

Maia: Hello, asking your passengers to stand in this line that wraps around out of sight to get to the train for the terminal at Orlando is unconscionable. You need to fix this with buses or something ASAP. It left a very bad taste in my mouth after a long trip.
Customer Service Agent: We understand that waiting in line after a long flight is not ideal, Maia. But the 'trains' between the Main Terminal and Gates 1-59 are currently being installed to replace the old ones.
Maia: I understand WHY they are being replaced and I understand it is the responsibility of the airport, but it is more than just not ideal. Traveling during the holidays is stressful enough. Being ok with cutting capacity in half is very disappointing. Is anything being done at all to ameliorate the issue? Or is it just a “too bad, so sad, not our problem” situation?
Customer Service Agent: Airport renovations are something we look closely at as we understand it will affect how our customers are able to get to and from their flights. We don't look to reduce flights as we know that takes travel options away, but we do look at available options and workarounds... that can be put into place in coordination with everyone involved at the airport to help things run smoother. Unfortunately, longer lines are part of the process until the improved product is finished.
Maia: And what is the workaround that has been put into place for this contingency? All that is communicated to passengers is ""we only have one shuttle running."" An earlier message also indicated busses might be used. That is all that is obvious to passengers. One might also question the wisdom of making these improvements during the holidays unless absolutely necessary. Also something not communicated to passengers.

At 8:00 p.m. I got an email from MyChoice saying that my scheduled delivery was now rescheduled to Monday. No explanation, of course. Note of course that I lost a day and a half of paid time off for that. So today I head home again to wait, nothing. Around 5 I get an email from MyChoice saying they tried to deliver but ""the business was closed""! I'm not a business, my doorbell works, I was awake, door not even locked. I called, they said I’d hear back by 7 pm. To their credit, a guy did just show up but asked for help carrying the 140 lb box up the stairs? Good thing I’ve been going to the gym? In conclusion, next time a business tries to ship me something with MyChoice, I’m going to have to go elsewhere.

Amazon Support: I'm sorry to see this! Please let us know what the outcome of your call is, we'd like to help if we can.

Joliz: After continuously keeping me on hold for close to 45 minutes now Amazon Help asks if they can call me back in an hour. The outcome is that I'm not being helped and I don't know how else to get help. I straight up asked, do you not have notes from my phone call 4 hours ago? The rep said ""we don't do that"". I'm sorry a company as big as Amazon does not keep notes on customer calls? You have got to be kidding me. I am not receiving notifications on any gift purchases from wish lists & the last rep I spoke with wouldn't transfer me to the registry dep.

Amazon Support: I'm sorry you weren't transferred. Did they provide a reason? Our Registries department has limited phone support hours.

Joliz: She said ""I already spoke to my supervisor"" when I asked her why I couldn’t be transferred. To be clear, the reps I spoke with 4 hrs ago were great and were the ones who suggested I call back if the issue persisted. The issue persisted, I called back & despite me sharing what my prior convo was, the person ignored my questions & the fact I had just gone through all the steps 4 hrs ago & stuck to a script instead of directing me to support that could help. I’m a longtime prime member who's usually always had positive experiences with your customer service staff. This was not one of them. And more frustrating is that instead of moving me to a DM like most companies have to sort the issue, you have me publicly replying to you. Which hey, if that’s how you wanna handle it by all means.

Chris: Negative. There was a crew on board that was taken off by Charlotte Police! This is really, really bad. Never before have I seen a cop take a crew off a plane! So as I learned the original crew got into a fight with the cleaning crew. The flight required a police report. This, your crew delayed a whole flight over an issue that likely wasn't an issue. Now they will start to board the flight! Almost 1 hour delayed on boarding due to American Airline employee problems. Over 20 years of flying this is a first. Terrible service.
Julia: We see that you're now boarding with an estimated departure of 9:10p. Our apologies for the disruptions to your travels this evening.

Elin: Hi, how may we assist you today?

Customer Care: Hi, could you help me to check for this flight it is confirmed? As that day (18 November 2017) I bought the ticket already but they emailed me saying that the transaction was unsuccessful but the amount is deducted from my bank account.

Elin: Hi there, as we checked booking not found with the guest name and flight details. May we have the screenshot of the payment slip?

Dan: Hello, how long is it before you contact someone who's taken my bag by mistake? I've got a lost luggage ref number. Got told today that a similar bag got left so that's who probably has mine. I've got the majority of my clothes in it and want them back asap.
Julie: We're sorry, Dan. If we delivered your bag to the carousel and someone else picked it up we're not responsible for contacting them on your behalf. However, if there's been a bag left behind we'll do all we can to get in touch with that customer for them to retrieve it.
Dan: When I spoke to BA on the phone earlier they said there had been a bag left behind that is similar. They said you can't return theirs until mine has been returned. It's a bit annoying that you can't contact them and enquire if they have mine by mistake. What are my options?
Linds: Hi Dan, I can appreciate your frustration. Unfortunately, we're unable to do anything until your bag has been returned, as you already know. You could contact the police and report your bag as stolen, or file a lost bag claim with your travel insurance company.
Dan: So people can just get off your flights and take whatever baggage they want? Great that is!! You literally have to ring up one person and you won't. I'll not be using BA again in a hurry!
Kev: Hi Dan. As soon as the passenger who has collected your bag gets back in touch with us, we'll have more information. I'm sorry we're unable to assist further.
Dan: Thanks Kev, how long do I need to leave it before putting a claim in with you or the insurance?
Kev: Hi Dan. If another passenger has your bag, you wouldn't be able to make a claim with us. You may be able to claim through your insurance so you may want to contact them.
Dan: So is there absolutely no possibility that you can contact the person whose bag was left and ask? Obviously I would but you wouldn't be able to give me their details. I've got presents etc. in the bag and no money to replace them now, so it's essentially ruined my Christmas.
Leanne: We wouldn't be able to give you their details for data protection reasons, Dan. We can't guarantee we can do anything, as your bag arrived on the carousel. However, please DM us your baggage ref, email, and postal address.

John: If an ATM doesn't work because of suspicious activity out of your normal withdrawal zone, why does it take money out of your account? Now hundreds are taken out of my account and not going to show up until Tuesday?

Customer Service Representative: Hello, we're here to help. Please use the link below to send your full name, ZIP code, phone number, and account type, and we'll follow up with you.

John: I don't see a link. I sent a DM, tried calling in but was told the wait time was 42 minutes...

Customer Service Representative: I called and left a message for you. What's the best time to reach you?

John: I just missed it. Call again. I called back, entered the extension, and left you a voicemail.

Customer Service Representative: I called and left a message for you. Please let us know if you still need help.

John: I called back and left a voicemail and tweeted right back. But of course, I never heard anything besides a tweet almost a day later.

Customer Service Representative: I called back and left a message. Please let us know when is a good time to call you.

Alex: I need help. I do not have your service (6+ hours to setup and cancel an install!) but the previous homeowner did. There is an ONT in the basement that sends out a loud, very annoying beep every 15 minutes? This is ridiculous. How do I stop it?
Customer Service: Press and hold the alarm silence button/ONT reboot button on the unit for 30 seconds. That will silence it.
Alex: Alright, done. Will reply back later if it beeps again. Am I expected to do this every 24 hours? That's how long the Alarm Silence lasted. Been back to beeping every 15 minutes since this morning.
Customer Service: Try unplugging the power and removing the battery. After 3 minutes, put the battery back in and power on. This should help with the beeping. Let us know.
Alex: I have no service with you at all. Can't I just unplug it and remove the battery forever?
Customer Service: Yes, you can do that since you do not have service with us. When the battery is dead the beeping will stop.
Alex: Thank you!
Customer Service: You are welcome!

Alex is experiencing a loud beeping frequently from an ONT in the basement installed by a previous homeowner, which is particularly annoying as they do not have the relevant service. Customer Service initially suggests holding the alarm silence button for 30 seconds, but this only works for 24 hours. They then advise unplugging the power and removing the battery to stop the beeping. Ultimately, Alex is informed that they can permanently remove the battery and unplug the ONT since they do not have the service.

Alex: I'm never buying from a third party seller on this platform again. I took a chance on one that had 99% feedback and they're trying to pull a fast one on me.
PJ: Hi, I'm sorry to hear this. Without giving any personal information, can you tell us what problem you're having?
Alex: Hi PJ. I ordered a laptop from a 3rd party seller. They sent the right kind of laptop but it's lacking features that were in the description: it was supposed to be a 2-in-1 laptop meaning it should have a touchscreen and fold into a tablet. The laptop they sent lacked those features. I tried contacting the seller, they didn't reply. I submitted a claim, they finally replied saying they would give me a refund after they sent this laptop back, which is no bueno. I'm currently a student taking online classes and I need a computer of some kind, so going through all the steps of sending the laptop back, waiting for my refund to be available, and then ordering a new laptop and waiting for it to get here will take too much time. I just want them to send the right computer I ordered. I think I can manage sending them this one back first and waiting for the correct one. If you can help get me the laptop I ordered, that would be amazing.
CN: Hello! Apologies for the trouble this has caused. When did you file the claim?
Alex: It was yesterday and I received the reply like an hour ago.
Jenna C.: Have you replied to the seller expressing your concerns about returning the laptop? Have you also asked if they are able to send the correct laptop out?
Alex: Another representative (Jet N.) has emailed them on my behalf, but if it's gonna be like last time, I'm not expecting a speedy reply.
CN: We allow sellers 2 business days to reply. Keep us posted!
Alex: Also, I just want to let y'all know, all my anger and frustration is directed at this seller and not y'all. Amazon has actually been nice, professional, and helpful in trying to help me.
Jenna C.: Not a problem at all! We completely understand the frustration when problems occur! Let us know if you are able to get a resolution with the seller.

Alex complained about receiving a laptop from a third-party seller that did not have the advertised features, such as a touchscreen and foldable design. The seller initially did not respond but later agreed to issue a refund only after the laptop was returned—an impractical solution for Alex, who needs the laptop for online classes. Seeking assistance from the platform, Alex explained the time constraints and asked for help in getting the correct laptop. The conversation included responses from platform representatives who advised Alex on the claim process and seller reply timelines, emphasizing their support and understanding Alex's frustration.
