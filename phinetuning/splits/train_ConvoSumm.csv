Rachel: Have you ever wondered why the Observers in Fringe always eat really spicy food?

Alex: I think it's because they're portrayed as being emotionless and somewhat disconnected from reality. They don't seem to experience time in a linear way either.

Mira: But we've seen incidents where they do show some emotion. Like when August fell in love with Christine Hollis and how September has an emotional attachment to Walter. Maybe they can only taste spicy food because it's the only sensation they can feel?

David: I came across something interesting. In episode 4 of season 1, Walter offers root beer to the Observer, but he declines saying he could hardly taste it. So, the spicy food thing might be because it's all they can taste.

Sarah: According to the Fringe Wiki, they have technology that allows them to control their own evolution. This technology enhances rational thinking by forming new ridges in the brain but destroys emotion centers, which also affects their sense of taste. They might only eat spicy foods because that's the only way they can feel what they are eating.

Kevin: Capsaicin, the spicy component, forms a nerve barrier and blocks sensation. If the Observers are always eating spicy food, their taste buds might be blocked by the capsaicin, making them unable to taste anything unless it's spicy.

Emily: I read that in their quest to become more advanced, they reacquired some reptilian traits. Reptiles typically have few or no taste buds. Maybe their diminished sense of taste comes from this reptilian side, and they react to spicy food through cranial nerve irritation instead.

Ahmed: I missed my suhoor this morning. Do I still have to fast?

Sara: Eating suhoor is sunnah, not obligatory. Prophet Muhammad said to eat suhoor, but fasting during Ramadan is obligatory for every Muslim.

Ahmed: So even if I missed suhoor, I should continue the fast?

Ali: Yes, you have to fast. Suhoor is not a pre-requisite. It's a sunnah, meaning there's blessing in it, but it's not obligatory.

Zara: Exactly, fasting has certain conditions like being Muslim, beyond puberty, in a sound state of mind, and not being sick or traveling. Suhoor isn't one of those conditions.

Ahmed: That's helpful. So making the intention to fast is more important?

Lina: Yes, you need to make the intention for fasting. The intention can be made anytime after sunset until midday. Even if made before midday, the fast is valid.

Hassan: And remember to recite durood shareef before and after making the intention. Suhoor is highly recommended but not compulsory for fasting.

Fatima: Many people don't take suhoor when the fasting time is short and eating time is long. The Prophet said there's blessing in suhoor, but you can still fast if you miss it.

Patrick: I constantly lose my keys, phone, and wallet. I tend to leave them inside the car, house, bathroom, and public places. It costs me a lot of valuable time and increases my stress levels. Do you have any tips on keeping my valuables in check? 

Linda: Have you tried putting your phone on a leash? Tether all your stuff to your belt loop and you won't be leaving it everywhere. 

Kevin: Personally, I mentally recite the mantra ""wallet, phone, keys"" about a dozen times a day, while tapping the relevant pocket. Eventually, the mantra becomes a single block that you recall in its entirety rather than a list of items to be remembered individually. Combined with the tapping, you learn to recognize both patterns and notice if you're missing an item.

Emily: I used to have this problem in the morning when getting ready. I'd carry my phone until the first point I needed both hands and put it down somewhere. I started making a conscious effort to put my phone in a specific place every morning. It felt unnatural at first, but now it's a habit and I rarely lose my phone.

James: This is probably a focus and habit issue as opposed to forgetfulness. Try doing one thing at a time and extend the boundaries of your start/finish areas. For example, the start of driving to work isn't when you get in the car but everything leading up to it. Build habits by marking off a calendar when you remember your keys/wallet/phone and aim to not break the habit chain!

Mark: Here's a hack that might work. I keep a $20 bill in my car. If I misplace any items, the next day I hand the $20 bill to the first stranger I meet. It motivates me to remember my stuff! I also use Lookout on my phone.

Amit: Which is the nearest airport if I have to travel to Harrow? Harrow is a suburban town in the London Borough of Harrow, in the north-west of Greater London, England, 10.5 miles northwest of Charing Cross.

Emily: There are 5 main airports in London. Gatwick is southwest, London City is in the inner east, Luton is north, and Stansted is northeast and far. Heathrow is in the west, about an hour away from Harrow by public transport. For fun, I plugged them all into Google to check times by transport (public). Luton: 1 hour 20 to 1 hour 30; Heathrow: about an hour; Gatwick: surprisingly, 1 hour 5 min to 1 hour 20 - the Gatwick Express helps! Stansted: 1 hour 30 to 1 hour 48; London City: 59 min to 1 hour 20, depending on the time of day. From personal experience, avoid Stansted and Luton, and not many fly into London City. So, I'd be looking at Gatwick or Heathrow, mainly.

Michael: Geographically, of the major London airports, Heathrow seems to be closest. If you plan to take a cab or rent a car, then Heathrow is probably the best, followed by Stansted and Luton. If you want to travel by car, I would avoid Gatwick (other side of London) and London City (as the name suggests, in the city centre) airports. On the other hand, if you plan to travel by public transport, then distance often bears little relationship to travel time. Busses are slow, and trains tend to go to/from central London. Neither of the Harrow rail stations is on the same rail line as any of the airports. Heathrow still seems to be the best, but after that, it's a wash in terms of travel time (though probably not travel cost) between City, Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton.

Sarah: Mark provided a good factual answer about London's airports, and David added a couple of good subjective points (cheaper flights, time convenience, etc.). I would add that, from personal experience, if you are planning to travel by car, then Luton or Heathrow would be best, as they are roughly the same distance from Harrow, and you'd be travelling through roughly the same volumes of traffic (possibly, a bit less traffic from Luton). If you are planning on using public transport, then I would recommend Heathrow, as it's much better connected, with a variety of public transport options, and you can get from Heathrow to Harrow on the Hill using only tube and public bus. Have a look at Google Map options and note that on the Piccadilly line, you can switch at Acton Town station, no need to go to Hammersmith - this would save you another 10 minutes or so.

John: As Mark's answer shows, except for Stansted, the travel times from the major London airports to Harrow are basically the same. The differences between them aren't significant compared to other aspects of your journey. For example, flying at a time that's more convenient for you, picking a cheaper flight, or a route with better connections would probably all make a bigger difference than the possibility of saving 15 minutes travelling from the airport to Harrow.

Anna: If you are looking for a nearby airport, then Northolt Airport is just 5 miles away from Harrow. If you are looking for an airport that is easily reachable by public transport, then London Heathrow Airport is the best.

Lena: If the medicine can be administered with a syringe (without a needle), the easiest method is actually sliding the syringe tip along the inside of the cheek, to the back of the mouth. Squirting the medication there will force the cat to swallow it.

  Rachel: I'm trying to say that a certain individual adds noise to any place he goes. When someone, figuratively, enhances the mood of a room he enters, we say he lights up the room. Is there any way to use sound as a verb to get the same idea across but with sound?
  
  Jordan: Actually, he brightens up a room or *he lights up a room* would most likely include sound since he is not a light source but rather a live, animated presence.
  
  Emily: One particular form of adding sound is ""chatting up."" To engage someone in light, casual talk: He would be chatting up folks from Kansas. You might also say ""regale"" to entertain or amuse someone with talk; he regaled her with a colorful account of that afternoon's meeting. Or you could say ""He lilted through the room,"" which means to sing or play in a lively cheerful manner.
  
  David: The intransitive verb form of ""noise"" means to talk much or loudly. By analogy with ""lights up a room,"" you could say that someone ""noises up a room.""
  
  Sandra: Sound would bring in connotations of testing out the feeling of the room, as, say, a comedian might, related to the nautical ""sounding"" meaning to test the depth of the water so you don't run aground. One could ""sound out a room"" in this sense. ""Sound up a room"" just sounds odd, and few people would have any idea what you meant.
  
  Monica: When you say ""add noise,"" I'm assuming you mean this in a negative light. Instead of telling compelling stories that hold people in rapt attention, the person is loud and boisterous, perhaps uncouth. He clamors for attention wherever he goes. ""Clamor"" is defined as to shout or talk loudly. He adds din to the room wherever he goes. You could also say, ""He adds commotion to the room wherever he goes."" It's not a verb, but it might be the most accurate way to describe his boorish social skills.
  
  Michael: ""Fill the room with sound"" is how it would be used. You can ""quiet down"" a sound, like a teacher telling students to ""quiet down."" You could ""lift up"" a sound, as in ""lift up your voice."" You could ""sound a trumpet"" which would fill up the room with noise. Then maybe you could ""sound a choir"" in the same way, though I haven't heard it used that way. You can ""sound an alarm,"" and this would be a verb.

Alex: I notice I tend to rest the little finger of my picking hand on the body of my guitar, typically on the edge of the sound-hole, for greater accuracy and steadiness of the picking hand. After extended periods of time, this finger can start to ache, which makes me wonder if using it like this can cause injury in the long-term. Is it ideal to use this finger like this or not?

Erik: I don't think there's an ideal or not ideal. It can be a good technique for accuracy, but you lose speed. It is worthwhile having as another technique in your arsenal. I use it a lot and I think practice will make it less of a strain for you, but you will also find that you can improve your free hand accuracy over time anyway.

Marta: I find that anchoring my hand like this limits my range of motion to an unacceptable degree, so I try to avoid it.

Lucas: I had a teacher who told me to do this and at the time it was great. I wasn't getting into very advanced playing, so I didn't need that extra mobility. There's nothing wrong with doing it, but you won't always want to because it does limit your mobility in your picking hand. Also, if it's causing any pain, you really shouldn't do it. It won't go away, and it could cause long-term injury. You should either find a different way of anchoring your pinky or stop doing it altogether.

Sara: There are those who maintain you shouldn't and others who do it all the time. I do so if I'm Travis picking, seems to help with accuracy. However, not when I'm playing jazzy complex chords as I use more fingers... And never when flatpicking.

Jonas: Actually, this is not a very good technique. You are not supposed to rest your finger. If you watch famous guitarists, you'll probably see that they follow this technique, but they only use it while performing, and, I guess, without noticing it. For example, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, John Frusciante, etc. But of course, you know you are not Jimi Hendrix, and even these players, I believe, try to avoid resting the little finger while they practice. If you want to check what's the best technique, you should definitely see videos of great Jazz players, who usually have an excellent technique even while performing.

Liam: Maybe you should, maybe you shouldn't. I personally tried to do this but didn't find it helpful. If someday you find yourself really uncomfortable doing it, you'll just stop. In fact, people tend to overstate the power of habit: it's not like it will take you years to stop doing it. While it helps you, stick with it.

Eva: When I first started to learn, the default seemed to be to place the little finger to anchor. As I progressed I found that naturally I was actually doing it less and less. What I would say was that it did help in the beginning as it encourages your muscle memory for where the strings are.

Miguel: I don't know how to phrase my question better, but I just want to know if there will be any little difference if I directly replace one with the other.

Sophia: I think we can generally divide them like this, although the separation may not always be so clear. To study is the action, the devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject. To learn is the result of that action, gaining or acquiring knowledge or skill by study, experience, or being taught.

James: Well, you can study without learning, but you can't often learn without studying, at least in academic subjects. Saying ""I studied English"" means you took classes in English. It does not necessarily mean you learned anything. Saying ""I learned how to tie a clove hitch"" means you actually acquired a useful skill.

Anita: To learn is a much broader term than to study. I agree that learning is a result, but it is most often a result of no conscious action on our part. We learn from the moment we exist, taking in the lore of language and customs of those around us through all of our senses. We learn every moment of our lives, even while sleeping. When we study, we make a conscious effort to learn a specific lore. Learning is always the result, even if what we learn is that we can't make heads nor tails of what we are studying. But learning is a given whether we study or not.

Liam: Learning is gaining knowledge. Studying is pursuing knowledge.

Claire: In my case, just because I studied chemistry in high school does not mean I learned it.

Alyssa: I consider the difference more than subtle. You can study without learning and, yes, you can learn without studying. Studying is the act of trying to gain information. It generally results in learning. Learning is acquiring new information. It can result from study, but also from everyday life and experiences.

Alex: They are very distinct - study implies some kind of focus, while learning can happen by perhaps a broader mechanism. Usage would depend upon context. Study also can be a verb or a noun, so that might influence using or avoiding it depending upon context. For what it's worth, the term study is not used, for example, when discussing work towards degrees in England (at Oxford or Cambridge) - in that case, the term used is read, as in ""I read Maths at Cambridge,"" or ""What is Sally reading at Oxford?""

Emma: To study doesn't necessarily mean you'll learn anything. For example, in High School, I was required to study History, and it was very boring and I had trouble paying attention, therefore I did not learn anything.

Joshua: If I recall my time in the scouts well enough, I'd suggest the following: a set of screwdrivers, an 8-10oz hammer, a set of pliers, a small chunk from a bar of cheap soap for coating screw threads, a piece of chalk for marking things and absorbing moisture, a small framing square, and a retractable tape rule. If you shop around and hit discount stores, it's not an expensive proposition.

Emily: Magnetic stud finder is a great idea (many uses and kids love playing with it - and educational). Don’t forget gloves, safety glasses, and a little set of screwdrivers with mini pliers. Kids have toys they can try to fix and will need smaller tools to start with.

David: At around that age, I got a premade toolbox from a store for real cheap. It included a hammer, combo wire cutter/stripper/crimper, level, ratcheting screwdriver with various bits, miniature screwdriver set, adjustable wrench, assorted wire connectors, and an Exacto knife. It was almost everything I needed at that age, besides a soldering iron and related equipment.

Sophia: I would add a small spirit level and maybe a cheap adjustable wrench too.

Michael: And get some spares or loners so that no one is left without them. Nails hardly ever hit the hammerer but often squirt sideways and get the kid sharing the workbench. If this is just for carpentry, consider a pencil, a ruler (which can be made by just sticking marks on a stick), and a short saw. 

Rebecca: Actually useful tools are the ones that are well-made, even if they’re expensive. It's not very fun when the handle breaks; cheap tools can be dangerous. They might own some of these tools for the rest of their lives. I'd suggest a minimalist approach to mitigate budget concerns. They need a hammer with a secure head, needle nose and slip-joint pliers, a quality tape measure, and screwdrivers. An adjustable wrench would be nice but not crucial.

Liam: I've been using a carabiner through the strap to clip my helmet to my backpack. But it seems clumsy, and the helmet dangles around a lot. I've seen other people with helmets closely mounted on a bag. How do they do it? Is there some kind of clip for this purpose?

Charlotte: You can make your own retention system for any bag that will hold the helmet secure and close to the bag. I've done this on a few of my bags since I carry both bicycle and climbing helmets sometimes. You need some elasticated cord (often called shock cord) and some cord locks of an appropriate size for the diameter of the shock cord you have. Thread this through a strap or some webbing on the bag and use the cord locks to make a size-adjustable retaining loop. Alternatively, you can use shaped pieces of wood or plastic as toggles through the helmet's vents.

Thomas: I just use the strap with its own clip. It does swing around though. Some bags have an elastic net that works very well. Maybe you can get the carabiner through both sides of the strap? Replacing the carabiner with a tighter strap might be a good compromise.

Megan: Stick on or sew on a Velcro fastener on the strap close to the helmet and on a suitable part of the backpack. You could also use an industrial-size press stud fastener. Hopefully, you don't carry the helmet on your backpack while riding.

Ethan: I would suggest trying to clip the helmet chin strap around both backpack shoulder straps or, if the backpack isn't too big, around the whole backpack. There's also the option of using a rubber strap with hooks to fasten your helmet. Personally, I find it faster to hang it around the stem and handlebars for quick access compared to detaching it from the backpack.

Olivia: My backpack has a dedicated helmet holding piece, but I don't use it because it requires adjusting six adjustment straps. Instead, for longer climbs, I clip the chin strap under both of the top cover straps which keeps the helmet mostly in place. For short climbs or when going into a shop, I clip the shoulder strap to the plastic ring on the backpack's shoulder strap, making it easier to put on and take off without stopping.

Jennifer: In the Event Horizon movie, the crew figures out the ship has been to Hell. But I'm curious; does it go to Hell in a biblical sense, or does it visit something more akin to the universe the Cenobites come from?

Michael: The ship travels by using a black hole to create a wormhole, but instead of Proxima Centauri, the wormhole led to an alternate dimension, a dimension of pure chaos, pure evil. So I suppose whether that qualifies as the hell from the Bible depends on your interpretation. I don't recall any of the flashbacks including the torment of long-dead souls, so I'd suggest that no, it's not the biblical hell, just a terrible place.

Emily: Well, there was a scene that didn't make it in, and in that scene Miller's not actually fighting Weir; he's fighting the entity that came back with the ship. Miller asks it if it is the devil, and the entity tells him he's not the devil but the darkness behind the stars and that it had been around since before the Big Bang, so no, it's not Hell.

David: But wherever the place is that the ship visits, it looks an awful lot like the things HP Lovecraft dreamt up. Also, Deadites are from the Raimi movies, it was Cenobites in the Hellbound Heart.

Samantha: Although the script is relatively vague, there's enough contextual clues to make a reasonable assumption that the ship was actually in Hell. The distress call literally translates as ""From Hell."" Justin states that he's been in ""The other place,"" and they have ""Visions from Hell.""

Brian: The original captain of the Event Horizon, after gouging his own eyes out, speaks a warning in Latin. Perhaps, then, the most relevant question is whether he or any member of the original crew knew Latin before they turned the experimental hyperdrive on. It stands to reason that if no one on the crew ever learned this language before the incident, it must have been taught to the captain by someone or something other than a crewmember after the activation of the drive. Since literal Biblical demons are frequently depicted as speaking Latin in modern media, this would be evidence in favor of the Event Horizon having passed through the literal Biblical Hell, rather than merely some unpleasant alien dimension. In short, who taught the captain Latin? Was it a demon?

When I re-pack my suitcase to go home at the end of the trip, I put any clean clothes in the bottom of the suitcase, then put the closed trash bag full of dirty clothes on top of it. The plastic trash bag keeps the clean clothes from getting dirty, and it also helps me unpack quickly at home. I just take the bag out and empty it right into my laundry hamper.

David: Get a suitcase with a zip cover on each side. The clothes get put in the dirty side once you've worn them. They stay separate unless you forget to zip one side up before you close it, of course.

Priya: I use separate ziplock bags for smelly/dirty clothing, for used but can be used again, and for small items of clothing that tend to get lost between the bigger items. When you do your laundry while traveling, you fold the bags and store them till you get the same level of dirt again. Instead of ziplock bags, you can also use the thin nylon shopping bags or wash bags which are quite easy to get these days.

Charles: Is there anyone out there who can tell me whether I've got this right? As I understand it, braille is usually abbreviated, and there are different conventions for abbreviation depending on the language. In other words, there's French braille and German braille. If this is the case, is it possible that a sentence written in one language and contracted will appear logical in another language but have a different meaning? And if so, will this occur more than once in any person's lifetime?

Joe: Yes, you're correct that many languages abbreviate braille according to the specific letter groupings and pronunciations of that language. It's also true that the appropriate treatment of braille depends on the context. For instance, French braille in France differs from that in Quebec, which is different again from British or American variations. So, ambiguity is possible, but usually, the brain can sort out the context to understand the right meaning. In English braille, for example, the slash (/) and the letter-group ""st"" have the same braille representation.

Charles: That's fascinating. So does this mean current work in braille code design is aimed at removing such ambiguities?

Joe: Exactly! Work towards a Unified Braille Code (UBC) is in progress, focusing on minimizing these ambiguities, especially for technical notation. The International Council on English Braille is debating whether language switches should have an explicit signal in braille.

Lloyd: Joe's explanation is spot-on, especially considering his extensive experience in braille translation software. There's definitely potential for confusion in short sentences, but most people can figure things out. Also, contracted braille isn't typically encoded as HTML. In projects like WebBraille, we provide contracted braille material ready for embossing on braille devices.

Charles: Are ICEB, BANA, etc., involved with or aware of this WAI group?

Joe: Yes, both ICEB and BANA are aware of WAI and share its goal of promoting accessibility. Automatic braille rendering from the web and electronic sources is increasingly important, and UBC is part of this effort.

Charles is seeking confirmation on the conventions of abbreviated braille across different languages and potential ambiguities. Joe confirms that different languages and even regional variations use different braille conventions, leading to possible confusion like the slash (/) and ""st"" having the same representation in English braille. There is ongoing work towards a Unified Braille Code (UBC) to minimize these ambiguities, especially for technical notation, with the involvement of bodies like ICEB and BANA. Lloyd emphasizes the practical aspects of contracted braille, mentioning projects like WebBraille that provide material for braille devices, contrary to typical HTML encoding.

                        Ana: I would have said that the link was an onomatopoeic one. It is based entirely on the closeness of sound, as opposed to meaning. Onomatopoeia is defined as 'the formation of a word from a sound associated with what it is named'. Usually that 'sound' is a natural sound, like cuckoo or sizzle. But I see no reason why it shouldn't be another word, especially one in a different language. Based on meaning, I suppose in France he might be known as Guillaume Portes.

                        Alex: If you are interested in a private language answer: my family would say, ""That's very Mots d'Heures,"" after the brilliant book written by Luis D'Antin Van Rooten.

                        Maria: If the first term makes you think of the second term, you could describe it as evocative, bringing thoughts, memories, or feelings into the mind, according to Merriam-Webster.

                        Peter: If your brain votes for things, then you are using free association. The method of free association has no linear or preplanned agenda but works by intuitive leaps and linkages which may lead to new personal insights and meanings. In my reverie, I free-associated Bill Gates, and my subconscious came up with Guillaume Gateaux.

                        Sophie: Faux amis or false cognates might be applicable. This expression applies to words whose similarity lies only in their structure, sound, and/or letter sequences. My French mum always uses it when people try really direct translations that result in real French/English words having meanings completely different from that intended.

                        Tom: A malapropism is the use of an incorrect word in place of a word with a similar sound, resulting in a nonsensical, often humorous utterance. An example is Yogi Berra's statement: ""Texas has a lot of electrical votes,"" rather than ""electoral votes."" More examples include Archie Bunker calling Orthodox Jews ""off-the-docks"" Jews, referring to the Women's Lubrication Movement rather than Liberation, and ""Peach 'n cake"" instead of ""Piece of Cake.""

Lina: I heard that having a fire in a cave or under an overhang could cause rocks to collapse and it could be really dangerous. Is that true?

Ali: Is it a real risk? I think it's higher with softer rocks like sandstone since they can crack and break due to heat. With granite, the risk might be lower, but I wouldn't risk it unless the cave is large and well ventilated.

Jasper: Another problem is that the smoke from the fire can affect cave-dwelling species, particularly bats. In winter, the smoke and warm air can wake them up and drive them out, leading them to freeze or starve to death.

Monica: The rule of thumb is that the rock shouldn’t get hot. Heating the rock makes water inside evaporate, which can cause cracks. If you’re just using the fire to warm yourself or cook modestly, it should be okay. Just make sure it’s a moderate fire so the rock doesn’t even get warm. And definitely avoid throwing bigger stones into the fire—they can explode.

Kyle: I once lit a fire in a cave and we had to evacuate because of the smoke and a swarm of spiders dropping from the ceiling! It wasn’t dangerous for me in the UK since we don't have deadly spiders, but elsewhere, it could be a significant danger. Instead, consider using a reflector fire to bounce the heat inside the cave and funnel the smoke across the cave mouth.

Aria: Initially, I thought the danger sounded like an urban myth. Then I read about a sad story from 2009: A 16-year-old boy was crushed to death by falling stones in a cave, probably unsettled by the heat from his campfire. A geology expert confirmed that a pre-existing weakness in the cave combined with the heat to cause around 200kg of rock to fall.

The conversation covers the potential dangers of lighting fires in caves, including the risk of rock collapse, particularly with softer rocks like sandstone. Concerns were raised about the impact of smoke on cave-dwelling species, such as bats, which can be forced out of the cave and subsequently die from exposure. Practical advice was shared on keeping fires moderate to avoid heating rocks and causing cracks. Personal experiences highlighted additional risks such as smoke evacuation and encounters with wildlife. A tragic incident from recent times was mentioned to underscore the real risks involved.
