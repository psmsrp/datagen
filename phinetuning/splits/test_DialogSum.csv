John: So it looks like we start selling in the U.S. next year.
Chen: Did Mr. Lin put you in charge of marketing?
John: He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge, or whether he wants to hire an American. But even if he hires an American, I'll probably be transferred to our American office.
Chen: Where will it be?
John: We aren't sure yet. Maybe L.A. I think L.A. would be the best idea.
Chen: Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U.S.?
John: Yes, the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything. Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff. It's going to be good. We can compete more directly with them.
Chen: Great.
John: Our computers have a high level of quality now. We can demonstrate it. And our prices will be good. So I think it will really be worthwhile.
Chen: You seem excited about it.
John: Well, you know I studied marketing in America. So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me. I'd love to be part of the team.
Chen: Do you honestly think we can compete though? All the computer giants are there.
John: Yes, I do. I think we can compete. I think we can make a name for ourselves. It will be hard at first. But if we develop a good advertising campaign, I think we can break into the market.
Chen: The company will have to choose a good advertising firm. And then there's the problem of quality. How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good?
John: It takes some time. Because even if the quality is high, people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name. Name recognition is crucial.
Chen: Well, I hope it all works out, John. I think if you're part of the team, things will go well. But you know we'd all miss you here. So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving.
John: That's very nice of you to say. But if we set up an office there in the States, maybe you could try to become part of it.

John: How do you research your books?
Author: I always visit the places that I use as settings for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible—even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most characters are a mixture of the characteristics of two or more people.
John: I really like your books. I’ve just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulations on making the bestseller list yet again!
Author: Thank you. Let me sign it for you... there you go.
John: Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about?
Author: There’s a real mix of stories in the book. I haven’t finished all of them yet, though. Many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your business card, I’ll make sure you get an advance copy to review.

Jordan: What else can we do there besides seeing the rocks?
Alex: There's a stream running through the cave. You can row boats there.

Jordan: May I understand that the cave is in a place far from the town?
Alex: Not really. Since the ground is not strong, it's impossible to build roads or railways.
Jordan: Are there any restaurants where we can stay for lunch and have a rest?
Alex: There are some. They are mostly opened by the local people. So if you are not used to the local food, I'd suggest you take some food yourself.
