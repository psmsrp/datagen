				Liam: I recently upgraded to puncture-resistant tires on my road bike. The previous tires are old but still usable. Is there any value to doing anything other than throwing them out? For instance, is there any reason to keep them? Is it possible to sell used tires? If no one wants them, can/should they be recycled?
				Ethan: I usually gift them to people who need them. I use rather expensive tires and prefer them in mint condition. So, after a couple of months, I'll most probably change them. The old tires can still give 6-12 months of quality riding time to someone. I'll post on local riding forums with close-up photos of the tread, and usually, people will get them.
				Olivia: You could use your old tires for when you are on the trainer and your new tires for road riding. That way, your trainer won’t wear out your new tires.
				Emma: New tires are puncture-resistant, not proof. I keep old tires as a quick fix for such situations until I can buy new ones. I also frequently go to the cottage house with my bike, so I keep one old spare tire there.
				Noah: Tyres have steel or aramid beads in the edge. If you cut that off with workshop snips, it becomes a ~2 meter long flat length as opposed to a hoop. This flattened tread can be used for packing/padding things, and protecting things. Have also tried to make some rubber tyres for our council wheelie bins because they're horribly loud when rolled.
				Ava: In case your idea of tire reuse goes beyond reusing them on a bike, you can turn them into fashion accessories like belts, bags, wallets, or even waterproof tool rolls. Local bike shops or car tire shops might also accept them for recycling.

Emily: I searched Thesaurus but found nothing. Example sentence: The __ were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured.

James: Fare, as described at dictionary.com, is a slightly older word, but you will still find it at many restaurants. Note that fare is a singular, collective noun. For example, ""The fare was top quality, just like the restaurant review assured.""

Sophie: The words comestibles, victuals, provisions, and foodstuffs are occasionally used in a generic sense to mean things providing nourishment, including both food and drink. They certainly aren't common words though, and probably aren't perfect for your sentence. If you absolutely have to use a single word, the first two are, in my opinion, most suitable, although they may be considered rather old-fashioned and pretentious.

Liam: There isn't really a single word in regular usage that covers food and drink combined. ""Food and beverages"" is probably the most common term in the hotel trade. However, outside the trade, the expression ""food and drink"" is much more widely used. Note that when used in this expression, drink is normally considered a collective term, so it is not plural. The plural can also be used, but it is less common.

Mia: Offerings is a commercial term occasionally seen in marketing verbiage. Dictionary.com defines offerings as something presented for inspection or sale. For example, ""The offerings were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured."" Using any other food or meal term simply feels forced and overly encompassing.

Ethan: If the food and drink isn't the primary reason for being where they are served, you could say refreshments.

Ava: For the sentence and context in the question, I'd simply go with meal or food. The drink part of a restaurant meal is usually secondary unless you're a bit of a wine connoisseur.

Noah: Although it doesn't always refer to food and drink, I think the most natural word to insert in your example sentence is selections: ""The selections were top quality, just like the restaurant review assured."" It’s obviously food because we're talking about a restaurant.

Ricardo: Are there any ways to improvise a magnifying glass with common things you could find at any house? For example, if you have a medicine package, and you find yourself trying to read a leaflet with really small type, what could you use to magnify it?

Maria: If you have a smooth, cylindrical drinking glass made of clear glass, you could fill it with water. The convex shape of the glass will magnify the object behind it.

Gianni: Alternatively, if you have a clear plastic 2-liter bottle, you can cut off the top part that is rounded, fill it with water, and look down through the water.

Isabella: If you're having trouble because you're farsighted or nearsighted, or if it's too dark, try using a pinhole lens. Make a pinhole in a piece of paper and hold it close to your eye to look through. It will bring the image into focus.

Peter: Another quick fix is using your thumb and two opposite fingers to create a tiny triangular hole. It won't magnify, but it can help bring the text into focus.

Alex: There’s a good video that shows various ways to magnify sunlight to start a fire. It doesn't directly address reading, but it demonstrates how to improvise a magnifying ‘apparatus.’

Laura: For example, you can use the bottom part of a light bulb or create a lens using clear plastic wrap and water. Both methods involve manipulating clear materials and water to focus light.

Julian: Would a magnifying mirror do the job? Many women carry small makeup mirrors around with them.

Ide: I usually go with sans serif or serif without more precision. It seems to me that we can preserve some design and at the same time allow the user to keep their preferences. Of course, with only relative font sizes. Can this cause accessibility problems?

Demon: Don't write off all the other great browsers out there just yet. The news of Gates' takeover of the internet is somewhat premature. In fact, nothing from Seattle is even in my computer. I usually browse via the public domain browser LYNX. 

Jamie: While I am all for creating accessible websites, I think the ability to use different fonts is an important aesthetic consideration in web design - though of course these should always be set as font-families with the default sans-serif as an option. As long as fonts are defined using CSS and sizes are defined at a reasonable size by ems or percentages, I can't see any reason to discard them for the bland uniformity of default fonts for everyone.

Andrew: Personally, I like Verdana as it's just a little wider than Arial - my vision impaired colleagues find it better too. This is supported by SitePoint. There are two fonts specifically designed for maximum readability on screen, Verdana and Georgia. The only downside is that they do not print out very well. Arial and Times Roman are both very legible both onscreen and off.

Denise: For what it's worth, Verdana (sans-serif) was designed for use on computers, and scales better than comparable fonts such as Arial. There was also some good recent font research posted on CHIWEB. I'll check with my usability specialist to see if it's still available online.

Luis: I've seen trees with the lower trunks painted white in a number of places around the world but have never found a definite answer to why this is done. Does anybody know why you would paint part of a tree white?

Emily: In ""The Garden Primer,"" they say it's to prevent apple borers from tunneling into the trunk. Painting it with white latex paint makes it easier to spot the sawdust residue the larvae produce.

Oliver: It's also to protect younger tree trunks from winter sun and wind. You can either wrap them or paint them with white paint to prevent sunscald.

Nina: When trees are painted white at the bottom, it's called whitewashing. It helps reduce reinfestation of borers and can prevent secondary fungal infection caused by insects.

Antonio: I've seen this a lot in Arizona, especially on citrus trees. The white paint protects the young bark from the sun until the canopy of leaves provides enough shade.

Sophia: My mom used to 'whitewash' our trees in Kentucky in the spring to keep bugs away. The trees looked really pretty in the summer after being painted.

Matthias: In Germany, they use white markers on trees along roads to prevent cars from crashing into them. In other places, color marking trees means they are to be felled.

Hanna: Use a flat latex white paint. It helps keep the tree cooler and deters bugs. There are specific tree trunk white paints that preserve trees too.

Karol: In Poland, this is often done in late winter to prevent sunscald.

Asha: In Guyana, this is done for beautification. It makes the place look bright and beautiful.

Raj: I've recently developed a shellfish allergy, and I'm not sure what the best substitute for oyster sauce would be. I've read that the flavor of it is not really easily substitutable. What is the best way to substitute the flavor without inducing an allergic reaction?

Ming: The most widely-accepted substitute seems to be various sauces made from mushrooms. If you go to a specialty Asian food store, you might actually find a product called vegetarian oyster sauce, which is pretty much the same thing. Failing that, you can always substitute soy sauce, or hoisin sauce if you want a less watery texture. They won't be exactly the same, but it's the same general idea—dark, fermented, salty sauce rich in glutamates. 

Aisha: Try black bean sauce. The body and color of the sauce are similar, though there are coarse bits of beans in it, whereas oyster sauce is usually smooth. Add a shake of fish sauce to taste. Fish sauce alone may be too thin. Most fish sauces are fermented anchovies with added salt and maybe sugar. I just taste-tested this and found it to be a good substitute.

Emma: My grandmother makes vegetarian egg rolls for me. She uses a vegetarian oyster sauce you can find at pretty much any Asian food store. It tastes the same as the original sauce.

Luis: I have a recipe with frozen cooked black beans, sugar, miso soup paste, balsamic vinegar syrup. It's as close as I'll get with what's on hand.

Sophia: A mixture of Hoisin and fish sauce will be close to what you seek. Fish sauce is very thin and watery, whereas Hoisin sauce is thick, yet sweeter than oyster sauce.

Zara: I Heart Umami has a great vegetarian oyster sauce made with shiitake and dates. The sauce tastes really umami-rich and I love that it has no additives and is easy to make.

Jin: I would use a combination of light and dark soy, and perhaps a little sugar to bring back the sweetness.

Olivia: There's a recipe I use for Chinese greens in garlic sauce. It lacks some of the fishy complexity, but it is very close to oyster sauce. Basically, you fry chopped garlic in neutral oil until just off turning golden, add dark fermented soy and sugar, and thicken with cornstarch before tossing with steamed vegetables.

Ethan: There are several oyster sauce substitutes that are shell-fish free. Soy sauce is probably your best choice since the two sauces have similar tastes. Adding Worcestershire sauce usually gets rid of any distinguishable differences and it's shellfish free! Another option is mushroom sauce, which is vegetarian and super easy to make yourself.

Aki: I am allergic to mollusks and shellfish too but use Thai fish sauce with no problems. If you're at the beginning of your allergy, you can still try this. Do not use Indonesian shrimp paste, it will trigger a reaction for sure. I've been allergic for over ten years now and get a reaction from even slight bits of shellfish, but fish sauce is okay.

Rajesh: What is the most appropriate way to answer ""Is this John?"" on the phone in American English?

Jennifer: Personally, I would avoid ""it is him"" and ""it is he"" if you're trying to stick to idiomatic American English. They aren't grammatically wrong, but you wouldn't normally hear someone speak of themselves this way on the phone. Your other choices are good ones. Another option is, ""This is John"" or ""Yes, this is John.""

Michael: The technically correct answer is ""This is he."" This is because the verb ""to be"" is used in a special form called the copula. With copulative verbs, no action is indicated – rather a state of being is indicated – and so the second substantive, called the predicate, doesn't take the objective case. But, ""This is him"" is also very common. Your hiring manager might be very particular about this or might not care at all. It’s easiest to avoid the problem by simply answering, ""Yes, this is John.""

Anna: ""He doesn’t"" sound like a good way of talking about oneself. I’d drop that one immediately. ""Yes"" sounds too short and impolite. ""Yes, John speaking"" and ""Yes, speaking"" both sound perfectly fine.

Kyle: Since you're looking for an answer to ""Is this John?"", this implies that you must have initially answered the phone with ""Hello."" This is the normal default telephone greeting in the US. If you're expecting an important call, just answer the phone with ""John Smith"" or ""This is John.""

Sophie: ""It is"" would be quite unusual.

David: ""Yes"" or ""Yes, speaking"" both work nicely. There might be particular conventions depending on the country, but to my ear, both sound fine.

Liam: It might be grammatically completely wrong but idiomatic here in Scotland. Another answer I often hear is ""Speaking.""

   Kynn: But I am not sure that single-design pages will be able to deliver optimal usability in the future. For example, screen sizes will soon differ so drastically between high-end office workstations and small mobile devices that the same pages will not satisfy both. How does access for cognitively impaired users tie into this? If content needs to be actually rewritten for a new audience in order to make it comprehensible, is this the end of writing once and the beginning of specialized websites for each type of disability? Your thoughts are welcome.
   Marti: In an ideal world everything would be accessible to everyone all the time. But we don't live in that world. Whether it is the web or any other media there will be some practical considerations in the development of material. I am sure a case can be made for extremes but is there really any serious need to produce a driver's handbook in Braille? Has anyone considered the needs of a cognitively disabled person who is also blind? If the ideal of Universal Design escapes us, we should, I think, adapt in the best way possible with the target audience in mind. Thus, that fancy high-end system at the office shouldn't be spending a lot of time in a games area and I would rather not think about somebody using a phone-link to review a scientific paper while driving to work.
   Kynn: A blind grandmother helping her granddaughter study for a driving test?
   Marti: Of course, as I said a case can be made for almost everything. It remains for society to decide if it is worth the investment (time, money, resources) to meet each and every individual need. In any culture, the answers are likely to be different. None of this should ever stop us from striving to achieve an ideal world.
   David: Should a child be able to make an atom bomb? Make sure they are easy to understand, complete with icons showing the proper order of assembly?
   Marti: I am certainly not disagreeing with Universal Design concepts, just having trouble with where and how to draw the lines.

Johanna: I'm currently living in Switzerland. It's known for being an attractive location for companies, and there are quite a few American companies in Zurich. Living in Zurich is really expensive, like in London, but people still choose to live here. Salaries are high, but companies keep coming. Why is that?

Stefan: The cost of living is pretty high in New York City too. It has the highest Consumer Price Index of any U.S. city, and salaries tend to be highest there as well. But people deal with all the hassles of living in NYC because it offers so much activity. I bet the advantages are similar in Zurich: job opportunities, business opportunities, and lifestyle options.

Nina: In addition to what Stefan said, there are definitely other benefits in Switzerland: political stability, great location, lots of well-educated people, low crime and corruption, and access to money.

Thomas: Switzerland was once known for its high regard for private property rights, although that's recently changed with banks having to turn over account holder names to the U.S. government. Another appealing aspect is Switzerland's neutral policy. The government doesn't deploy the military globally, so there's no worry about payback from such actions. 

Martina: Also, Switzerland has a beautiful landscape, low crime rate, and hasn't been invaded for a couple of hundred years. It's close to major cultural centers and includes many of its own. Not everything is about money.

Hans: The lake is beautiful and Swiss people are well-educated, which is attractive to companies. We have low taxes, political stability, a stable currency, and a company-friendly environment.

Luca: Big companies find Switzerland to be business-friendly and often benefit from special tax regimes. But don't confuse the interests of companies with personal benefits.

Karl: For some context, here are unemployment figures for Switzerland and surrounding countries: Liechtenstein at 2.3%, Switzerland at 3.5%, Germany at 4.5%, Austria at 5.6%, France at 10.8%, and Italy at 11.5%. Liechtenstein has a small job market, while Germany's figure is the lowest it's been in decades. I'd expect Switzerland's unemployment to stay constant, making it easier to find a job here.

Laura: I understand that newborn's immune system is still weak and crowds or strangers should be avoided. But how soon can I take my newborn outside? Like for an hour's walk in a non-crowded park? Any particular things to pay attention to?

Emily: This pamphlet from the South Carolina Department of Health says it's safe at one month. Avoid large crowds, but the fresh air is good for the baby. Just avoid people touching your baby's hands since they might put them in their mouth. Also, dress the baby appropriately for the weather and avoid too much sun exposure. Personally, I'd take the baby for a walk as soon as I felt up to it, usually within days of birth.

Jack: Our pediatricians advised us to avoid anyone with easily transmittable diseases for the first six weeks. The main reason is you don't know who might be contagious. We took our daughter for short walks in the woods when she was a week old. It was more beneficial for me to get some fresh air, but as long as the baby is comfortable and protected, you can take her out.

Sarah: I've never heard that strangers should be avoided with newborns, and I wouldn't recommend staying inside. You need to get out for your sanity. Exposure to new environments is good for babies. Just avoid sick people, but don't go overboard.

Michael: Someone asked this in our new parents' group. The answer was, ""You already took your baby outside when you went home from the hospital. Find something else to worry about."" Handling by strangers is another story, but being outside with the right clothing and sun protection doesn't seem to be an issue.

Isabella: We took our newborn to a crowded shopping center at 3 days old. We were very careful, but nothing happened. She grew up fine. Be cautious as their immune system isn't at full strength yet, but they don't need to be cocooned either.

Yuki: Here in Asia, it's common to wait until babies are 3 months old before taking them out. We followed that tradition, and our child did well. The conservative approach works for us, especially with concerns about asymptomatic diseases. But we had friends and family over during those first three months.

Lucas: For us, it really depended on the weather. We live in the North of France, so it's freezing in winter. We didn't go out much with our newborn until he was 2-3 months old. But our daughter was born in summer, so after a few weeks, we started going out more progressively.

Anna: My wife and I went for a walk on the 3rd day in the hospital park. As long as the baby is wrapped properly to stay warm, everything is fine. Our hospital even provided the buggy and a little jacket for us.

Anna: Maybe if they were more visible and promoted within the app. People might not actively seek help, but having it right there could make a difference.

Jason: Social media is such a double-edged sword. It connects people but also isolates them.

Sophia: Yeah, and not everyone uses it the same way. For some, it's a lifeline, and for others, it's a source of constant comparison and stress.

John: Balance is key. Users need to be educated on how to use these platforms healthily, and companies need to be held accountable for harmful practices.

Jason: Agreed. It's a complex issue, but dialogue is the first step.

Gina: A lot of jeans have zippers that open on their own. For me, it is quite uncomfortable to be re-zipping them in the middle of the street. What can I do to prevent this?

Raj: A thing I have found is to get a key ring, large enough to be able to pass through the jeans' button. What I did was to pass it through the zipper-hook. Zip the zipper all the way up and hook the ring through the jeans' button.

Anna: In-built lock. It's already there on your zip. Most jeans zippers now come with an in-built lock. When you zip just make sure that the zip-hook is placed vertically down; this will lock the zip. Just try to open the zip with the hook placed down, it won't open. Some low-quality jeans might not use properly produced zips though.

Hiro: Two solutions, with some top-notch drawing (I'm clearly the next Vincent Van Gogh). Tie a thin piece of string through the hole at the top of your zipper and your belt. However, have the string go through the inside of your pants, then out from the top of your pants, and tied to your belt. Put tape on the inside of your pants where it's not visible and use this tape to hold the zipper in place.

Linda: I sometimes use a paperclip, passing it through the hole in the zipper and trying to attach it to the jeans' fabric. This requires testing until you find something that works for you.

Carlos: You could avoid the need to constantly rezip jeans by sidestepping the problem entirely. I only wear button/rivet fly jeans for this exact reason. All major manufacturers of jeans provide these designs.

Elena: Shevliaskovic’s answer is classic, but I have a couple more to add. Hairspray—spray it on the zipper. It makes it stickier or something. It works for a while, but you’ll have to reapply every so often. Also, get a pair of pliers, preferably needle-nosed, and squeeze each side of the zip mechanism gently to tighten its grip on the teeth. This is delicate work because you can easily break the zip doing this.

Peter: If your pants button and the zipper are magnetic, you might want to magnetize both by swiping them with a strong magnet around 100 times. This will cause them to stick to each other but can still be removed when you pull on them.

Sophia: Use a common safety pin. The very end of your zipper pull has a tiny hole. Use a safety pin through that hole and the cloth of the zipper to hold your zipper closed.
