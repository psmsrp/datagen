Mrs. Smith: I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University. Will you please tell me something about your related courses?
Mr. Sun: In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting, and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting, Commercial Accounting, Industrial Accounting, and Management Accounting.
Mrs. Smith: Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control?
Mr. Sun: No, we haven't taken such a course, but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making, by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making.
Mrs. Smith: From your school report card, I can see you did well in every course. But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience.
Mr. Sun: I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume. In fact, I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year. I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well. Here is the recommendation.
Mrs. Smith: You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English.
Mr. Sun: No problem. The professional English course is just English for Accounting. Moreover, as you know, the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture. When I served part-time there, I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English.
Mrs. Smith: That sounds fine. Why did you choose to apply to our company?
Mr. Sun: I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department. Her name is Lilling. She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested. I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company.
Mrs. Smith: Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees?
Mr. Sun: No, can you tell me about it?
Mrs. Smith: Of course. As for an entry-level accountant, we pay 1,500 a month in the first half-year. We have a grading system to evaluate your work. If you have made progress, we will certainly raise your salary. For beginners with a CPA certificate, they can earn at least 2,000 a month.
Mr. Sun: I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association, but the certificate won't come to hand until next month. How about that?

Bob: Really? Tell me about some of the plants they showed.
Alice: Well. There was one type of plant that catches insects and eats them.
Bob: Is that type of plant found in this country?
Alice: No, it isn't. it's a pity, because I'd like to see it in action.
Bob: So would I. what other unusual plants did they show?
Alice: They showed flowers that only provide their nectar to one type of butterfly or bee. The insect has to be the exact size to get the nectar. Other insects cannot get it. Of course, when the insect collects the nectar, it also takes some pollen from one flower to another.
Bob: That's very specialized. So, the insects and the flowers rely on each other. If one became extinct, the other would too.
Alice: That's right. That's one reason why it's so important to protect every species.
Bob: I see. The plants that fascinate me most are cacti. I find it amazing that they can survive in such dry desert conditions.

John: How is everything going with your girlfriend?
Alex: Didn't I tell you? It's over!
John: Oh, I am sorry to hear that. I didn't know that you had split up. What happened?
Alex: It was a few things. The first thing that happened was that we were supposed to go out for a romantic dinner for our one year anniversary, but she stood me up!
John: Really! Did she tell you why she didn't show up?
Alex: No, but I ended up finding out later that night when I saw her with another man at a club near my home!
John: What was she thinking? Did you confront her about it when you saw her?
Alex: I wanted to, but I knew that if I spoke to her, I'd just blow up at her, so I decided to just go home. I called her later that night, but she didn't answer the phone.
John: I can't believe she would do that to you. It's so dishonest—and rude!
Alex: I know. I still haven't heard from her. The good thing is that I'm so angry with her that I don't feel sad about not having her around.
John: I bet you she regrets what she's done. You were such a good catch! She really lost out, didn't she?
Alex: I guess so. It would be nice to know why she did this though.

Sophia: May, could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today?
May: Sure, no problem. Asking for leave again? You have been absent from class five times this semester.
Sophia: I know. But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time. No more than one third of her students will go to her class.
May: I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well. Most students either sleep or do other things in her class.
Sophia: Yeah, my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me. Or I chat with my friends through text messages.
May: Fortunately her class is just an elective course, not as important as compulsory courses.
Sophia: Right, so we must spare some time to attend selective courses.
May: But isn't it too impolite to be absent?
Sophia: What can I do? I have things to do in Students' Government.
May: Oh, I thought you just gave an excuse on this note.
Sophia: Sometimes I will try various excuses. But this is my last time asking for leave. Or I will have a bad record.
May: Yeah, besides, your credit will be deducted. That is kind of serious.
Sophia: I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students' Government.
May: You can't write with one hand and draw with the other.
Sophia: I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government. But before that, I must do my job. Bye. Don't forget about that note.
May: You can count on me.
