Angela: Another 28 minutes wasted on the phone to customer service. 8 out of 10 orders this month not turned up next day. Every time “we will make sure it doesn't happen again”. Well not anymore it won't as not going to renew. Wasting my time & money.

Customer Service: I'm sorry for the poor experience! To confirm, have we missed the delivery dates shown at checkout and confirmed via e-mail? When you spoke with us, what options or insight were we able to offer?

Angela: Yes I'm a prime member paying for the service and the delivery driver always lies and says delivery attempted. He says it's because Amazon fine him for delivering late so it's better for him to say he tried to deliver when he can't get round enough addresses. I have had someone in my house all day. No delivery attempted. I need the delivery for tomorrow and now it's not here and Amazon/their delivery partner is fibbing about trying to deliver. This has happened 8 times. You offered £5 credit, its cost me more than that in phone calls.

Customer Service: I'd like a member of our team to look into this with you. Please fill in the details here and we will be in touch.

Angela: Done. Don't want to be told “we will do everything to make it not happen again” as that has been proven to be rubbish. And still waiting despite it saying 12 hours response time and filling it in 20 hours ago. From bad to worse.

Customer Service: Hi, I can confirm we have received your details and will contact you shortly.

John: Never flying with you guys ever again! A normal 5 hour trip turned into 15 hours and having to spend an extra $400. Unbelievable!
Customer Service: We do our best to always get you to your destination on time and apologize for the extended travel time.
John: Your delayed flight and plane issues with the jet bridge caused me to miss my connecting flight. I had no choice but to pay $400... why do I have to pay for something that was your guy's fault? Such a crazy amount for something that was because of your plane messing up.
Customer Service: If your tickets were in the same reservation, our team would rebook you at no added cost.
John: The same flight reservation only leaves once a day from DFW-BOI. I would've had to stay overnight in Dallas and miss an extra day. I needed to be in Boise that day so was forced to buy a connecting flight. Your flight delay/issues aren't something I should pay extra for.
Customer Service: Our agents are certainly able to assist with any but we're unable to offer reimbursements for flights purchased on another airline.
John: I purchased the connecting flight from you though. I was told to pay the PHX - BOI flight was the only way to get to Boise that day. So...??

Agent: I'm sorry you only received two of the orders. Is this happening with the same carrier each time? We can see what options are available for the lost items, reach us by phone or chat here: https://t.co/hApLpMlfHN
Dave: Problems are mostly with AMZL US delivery, but this time it's UPS. UPS is usually pretty good. Also, the item isn't lost. I watched them deliver it. Status still says ""lost in transit"", though. No big deal, but it makes Amzn look silly.
Agent: Okay, thanks for that info, Dave. Have you received any updates via e-mail for the last two packages you were expecting? Let us know. We'd like to help in any way we can!

John: I’m using Wifi. I’m being logged out from my eBay account by itself after I try to log in to my PayPal at checkout to make a payment. I can’t take a screenshot though, because it happens so quickly at checkout that all I see is that I’m already at the eBay home asking for login again.

Spotify Support: Hey there! You can try following the steps at https://t.co/jnWe28bxRW. Let us know how it goes. On the other hand, we're afraid that local files will not appear under Your Library (Songs, Artists, Albums).
Anna: Please do. I've worked the past 10 years on creating those playlists in iTunes, and the whole purpose of migrating to Spotify is that it's social. So now I don't have any benefits of being a Spotify subscriber... Is there really no workaround for this? I wouldn't mind putting some time into making this work, but Spotify just has so little use for me if this can't be done...
Spotify Support: We're afraid this isn't possible, but we can see how that'd be handy. Your feedback has been noted. Don't worry, once you've imported your iTunes tracks, you can easily move them to playlists by following the steps at https://t.co/a38Mc2DlCx /WP
Anna: I think I'm missing the point. That article doesn't say anything about iTunes or how to move songs added through iTunes to playlists :-(

Deanna: Did you mess up our tickets on purpose because I complained? It's a major disaster. Why did you move my husband from a seat we paid for to a completely different seat 20 rows back?

Agent: We're not showing any seat changes. Please work with our airport team directly as the seat map is under their control at this time.

Deanna: We were supposed to be 17K and L. I verified this last night on the phone with an agent. They moved him to 27J. Those seats are not comparable. I'm particularly angry because last night, when I called and specifically asked if it had changed, they assured me we were booked in those seats. So today it was too late to get two seats together. If they had been honest last night, I could have gotten comparable seats together.

Agent: Deanna, we're seeing the same seats in the reservation. The change must have been made at the airport. Please work with them directly.

American Airlines Agent: We care about your experience and are here for you. Our apologies for the extra wait this morning. Did you need assistance with rebooking?
John: It is too late because of American staffing and not having customer service skills I missed my connecting flight which cost me money!!! I need to be reimbursed! Or compensated in some way or form. American Express even called for me to have this situated and your reservation department could not handle it and said it had to be done in the airport. Everyone keeps passing the puck!
American Airlines Agent: We ask passengers arrive with ample time to check in. We're sorry your flight was missed, but we're unable to offer anything further.
John: Time wouldn't be an issue if you had better customer-oriented staff and enough staffing as Delta does. I will never ever again fly with this company. Only reason why I got stuck with you guys is because my assistant thought I wanted a later flight rather than an early AM. Delta will always be my number one carrier as it has been. Never giving any other company a chance thanks to this company! Love you, Delta.

Jade: Why do y'all disconnect while in cut when you're in the wrong? I'm so upset with your customer service and would like to speak to a Supervisor.

Amazon Support: I hate that this happened. Without providing personal info, can you tell us what's going on? We'd like to help if we can.

Jade: Money was taken from my debit card for services I've never even used or received and now my money was put on another card? How'd y'all take my money from one card but say you refunded it to a whole other card? & I don't feel I should be compensated for your mishap.

Amazon Support: I'm sorry for the frustration so far. When you spoke with us, what insight was provided for you?

Jade: That I would have to locate where they “supposedly“ refunded it to. Why charge my card but not refund my card? Then just cut me off in chat.

Amazon Support: I'm so sorry for the poor experience. We'd like another chance to look into it with you via phone.

Jade: I've tried that twice already! What's the next step for me to take on this matter? Supervisor or management? I have all the screenshots and emails too.

Amazon Support: Reaching out via the link above would be the next step, so we can take care of it appropriately by phone.

Luca: Hi BA on flight BA0018 from Incheon today and am not going to make bag check. Is there anyone I can contact to speed thru?
Lisa: Hi, Luca. I've tried calling you, however the call is going straight to voicemail. Do you have a number I can reach you on?
Luca: I'm not sure if I can receive calls in Korea, I have enabled all my roaming features if it's now working. I can make a WhatsApp phone call if that is possible as that only uses data. I have added a travel module so I should be able to make and receive calls now. Should be 07704 499073 just to double check.
Lisa: Hi, Luca. Thanks for your time on the phone today. I'm genuinely sorry I couldn't give you the assistance needed. I do hope you manage to get through to your agent before your departure time. Many thanks.
Luca: Couldn't contact so I ditched the bottle of wine I had and managed to sprint through security and get to the gate in 20 minutes somehow. I would like to thank BA customer service though who were exceptional, especially at Incheon when I was a sweaty panicked mess.
