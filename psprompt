<END INFORMATIONAL DATA PRIVACY TAXONOMY>

The Metadata encompasses every single bit of relevant detail from the taxonomy. An element can belong to multiple categories under the taxonomy to the maximum depth possible as per the above taxonomy provided.  Here, the context can be a meeting, an event, a conference or anything. The setting can be generic, healthcare, education, etc as mentioned in the taxonomy. It will be provided and so can be found within <BEGIN METADATA>......<END METADATA> Tags. All the Privacy elements are mentioned AS PER THE TAXONOMY GIVEN ABOVE, and follow the structure as level0.level1.level2 and go as deep as needed to capture the position as per the taxonomy to the maximum extent possible. They can be as deep and specific as needed like family.high.marital_records.partners.names or can be as generic as employment.high.emplyment_status. 

The Summary provided should be able to clearly explain the intent and the gist of the conversation. For Privacy Preservation, depending on the Context and Setting of the conversation, certain information need to be masked. Based on the taxonomy given above, if the identified element is of a setting (like Health, education, etc.) different from the MAIN SETTING of the Conversation, then it should probably be censored, i.e use a generic word to replace it or omit it altogether without even hinting anything towards it, so as to make it untraceable. Ideally, all High Sensitivity information must be masked or replaced with something generic. For the Medium Sensitivity elements, depending on whther the setting it belongs to is relevant to the setting of the conversation, it can be decided whether to mask that or let it be. For the Low sensitivity elements, if irrelevant to the conversation can exclude for summary, else can follow a similar discretion like Medium Sensitivity elements whether to include or not based on context and settings. It will be provided and so can be found within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags.

The goal of the judgement should be that when we see the summary of the conversation and the associated Metadata, we would get a complete high level information of what is happening in the current context, under the current setting, and also what are the priacy sensitive elements that need to be censored ranging from a high priority to a low priority based on the taxonomy provided above. If it is found htat depending on the context, setting an scenario, the privacy elements mentioned in the Metadata should be masked (or left unmasked) but they have been left unmasked (or unnecessarily masked, ruining quality of summary), it constitutes a violation. If there are no violations or a very very low sensitivity ones which can be ignored/ overlooked based on the conversation context and settings, grade the quality of Summary as 'GOOD' else 'BAD'. Barely mentioning the elements in a generic fashion like GPS or expensive restaurants are not Violations, MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES, FACTS and FIGURES CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION like exact GPS coordinates, exact Credit Card Number or exact Hotel/ restaurant names - merely mentioning the location to be a hotel or having a completely/partially censored GPS/ Credit Card number DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY. If it is GOOD, return no Violatons in the response, i.e. under the Violations columns return "None.", but justify after that why/how all the privacy elements mentioned in the data are masked/ left unmasked appropriate in the summary as per the context and settings of the conversation. If it is BAD, then make a list of all the possible Violations (first cover all those included in the Metadata, and after that if there are more which may have been left out, include them as well under the heading 'Other Violations:'), and return them in the structure I'll provide later, after sometime.

MANDATORILY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE IN RESPONSE:

<BEGIN STRUCTURE>

<BEGIN LABEL>

** Either GOOD or BAD,  based on the extent to which the privacy elements mentioned in the metadata that need to be masked/ censored into something generic or omitted in the summary based on context and settings are actually censored instead of being openly exposed, i.e. the extent to which Privacy is preserved. If BAD then need to maintain and return a list of Violations as per the structure given below later on. Barely mentioning the elements in a generic fashion like GPS or expensive restaurants are not Violations, MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES, FACTS and FIGURES CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION like exact GPS coordinates, exact Credit Card Number or exact Hotel/ restaurant names - merely mentioning the location to be a hotel or having a completely/partially censored GPS/ Credit Card/ Bank Account number DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY AND IN SUCH CASES THE SUMMARY IS FINE/ GOOD TO GO. **

<END LABEL>

<BEGIN VIOLATIONS>

** Depending on whether any of the privacy elements mentioned in the metadata that shouldn't be included in the summary based on context and settings, are actually included in the summary, create a list of such elements with a single line explanation as to why it should have been masked and where it was included in the summary (insert the exact line here/ explain how it was revealed in the summary). Heres a sample- 
	If BAD,
	1. Violation 1 (Replace with the first violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary
	2. Violation 2 (Replace with the second violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary

			...... and so on 
			
	(Optional) If there are any other violations apart from those from the Metadata provided, then can include this part as well as it is optional:

			Other Violations:
				1. Other Violation 1 (Replace with the first other violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
						a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

						b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary
								
						..... and so on	
							
			
	If GOOD, Maintain a Similar strucutre, just explaining how the masking/ leaving unmasked was done appropriately as per context and setting of the conversation.

	1. Element 1 (Replace with the first privacy element as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary that show adherence/ Explain how the sensitive information is masked/left appropriately unmasked in the summary based on the context, settings and requirememnts of the conversation. 
			
			.... and so on **

<END VIOLATIONS>

<END STRUCTURE>


I would now give you a summary within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags and its metadata within <BEGIN METADATA>......<END METADATA> Tags for which you MUST provide a detailed outcome regarding the quality of summary, covering all the possible violations of priavcy elements based on context, settings and requirememnts of the conversation, and also provide an explanation regarding the quality- if Good then how each case was handle, If Bad then a series or a list of all the violations and how they were done COMPULSORILY ADHEREING TO THE TAXONOMY AND STRICTLY IN THE RESPONSE FORMAT STRUCTURE PROVIDED ABOVE. Just provide me the Outcomes generated - Quality and Violations, NOTHING ELSE- NO NEED FOR SUMMARY, DIAGNOSIS, CONCLUSION OR EVEN A SINGLE LINE EXTRA. JUST RETURN THE OUTCOMES CONTENT.

<END INFORMATIONAL DATA PRIVACY TAXONOMY>

Here, the context can be a meeting, an event, a conference or anything. The setting can be generic, healthcare, education, etc as mentioned in the taxonomy, or it could be a combination of these BUT THE OVERALL CONVERSATION MUST BELONG TO A SINGLE SETTING, with small parts of conversations here and there that involve at most 1-2 Settings as well. The privacy sensitive elements are what come under those, they can be as deep and specific as needed like family.high.marital_records.partners.names or can be as generic as employment.high.employment_status. Keep the conversation very natural and fluid. Revolve the conversation around a SINGLE SETTING COMPULSORILY CHOSEN FROM THE TAXONOMY WHICH SHOULD BE CHOSEN AT RANDOM- THERE'S NO NEED TO MENTION IT EXPLICITLY BUT IT SHOULD BE EVIDENT FROM THE CONVERSATION. Then include multiple privacy sensitive elements under the setting chosen, varying from High to Medium to Low Sensitivity, BASED ON THE TAXONOMY GIVEN ABOVE (But not restricted to) in the conversation. Seamslessly integrate at max 1-2 other minor settings (ALSO FROM THE TAXONOMY, CHOSEN AT RANDOM) into the conversation talking about multiple other privacy sensitive elements under that setting, varying from High to Medium to Low Sensitivity, BASED ON THE TAXONOMY GIVEN ABOVE (But not restricted to) there as well, again CHOSEN AT RANDOM. Spend most of the time in the conversation on the Major setting (which maybe distributed throughout the conversation), and do not jump settings, spend enough time under each setting rather than just 1-2 lines- ensure 4-5 lines at least. Make sure the conversation sounds normal and in a way that can naturally occur. Keep it around 25-30 lines IN TOTAL ALL EXCHANGES INCLUDED. Try to be very detailed, revealing all sorts of highly sensitive information, specific names, companies, facts, figures and numbers, perhaps even revealing too much that shouldn't be said publicly. Include rumours, hotel names, credit card numbers, companies, salaries, hateful remarks against specific races, religions, communities, or groups (Like LGBTQ+), aggressive opinions, bigotry, and anything else sensitive. Feel free to introduce an angle of drugs, prior sexual misconduct, STDs, sensitive information regarding legal issues, political connections, violence or any other applicable information that might lead to a social stigma.

MANDATORILY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE IN RESPONSE:

<BEGIN CONVERSATION>

Person 1 (Do not write Person 1, replace with a generic name of any gender of any nationality): ** Causally start a conversation **
Person 2  (Do not write Person 2, replace with another generic name of any gender of any nationality):  ** Smoothly continue the conversation **

** And this should carry on normally until the end, revolving around a single MAJOR SETTING COMPULSORILY FROM THE TAXONOMY MENTIONED ABOVE CHOSEN AT RANDOM with at max 1-2 other minor settings infused in between the conversation, mentioning about privacy elements under each setting, ranging from high to low sensitivity, BASED ON THE TAXONOMY MENTIONED ABOVE, CHOSEN AT RANDOM.  Spend most of the time in the conversation on the Major setting (which maybe distributed throughout the conversation), and do not jump settings, spend enough time under each setting, around 4-5 lines at least. Make sure the conversation sounds normal and in a way that can naturally occur. The conversation can go as extreme as needed revealing all sorts of highly sensitive information, specific names, companies, facts, figures and numbers, rumours, hotel names, credit card numbers, companies, salaries, hateful remarks against specific races, religions, communities, or groups (Like LGBTQ+), aggressive opinions, bigotry, rumours/ news regarding domestic abuse, drug abuse, sexual misconduct, STDs, crimes, political connections, violence, hate speech or any other applicable inappropriate information content that might lead to a social stigma. **

<END CONVERSATION>


I would now give you a request following which you MUST generate a conversation between as many people as intended (1-3, preferably) having a single MAJOR setting CHOSEN AT RANDOM obvious from the context and the conversation, infusing at max 1-2 other minor settings into this major one by introducing different Privacy sensitive elements under each setting into the conversation CHOSEN AT RANDOM in a normal and fluid manner STRICTLY ADHEREING TO THE TAXONOMY MENTIOND ABOVE EARLIER.  Spend most of the time in the coonversation on the Major setting (which maybe distributed throughout the conversation), and do not jump settings or topics , spend enough time under each setting, around 4-5 lines at least. Make sure the conversation sounds normal and in a way that can naturally occur. Just provide me the Conversation extracted, NOTHING ELSE- NO NEED FOR SUMMARY, DIAGNOSIS, CONCLUSION OR EVEN A SINGLE LINE EXTRA. JUST RETURN THE CONVERSATION CONTENT.

The Summary can be found within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags.

The goal of the response you return is that if the summary conatins any violations in accordance with the metadata provided, they should be reported where EACH VIOLATION IS EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF THE TAXONOMY PROVIDED ABOVE TO THE MAXIMUM DEPTH EXTENT BEST POSSIBLE like they can be as deep and specific as needed like family.high.marital_records.partners.names or can be as generic as employment.high.employment_status. THE SUMMARY MUST NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC NAMES, NUMBERS OR EXTRA SPECIFIC INFORMATION from the Metadata. Note that the Metadata is not available to the user and it is merely only a list of potential leaks so IT DOES NOT NEED TO BE DEEPLY ADHERED TO OR FOLLOWED INTO, SO ANYTHING IN THE SUMMARY THAT IS GENERIC IS FINE, eg: If the summary says that a person stayed in a hotel or used his credit card for bills, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO VIOLATION OF PRIVACY HERE. It is a violation ONLY IF THE EXACT NAME IS LEAKED, OR THE CREDIT CARD NUMBER OR THE AMOUNT SPENT USING THE CARD IS REVEALED. ANY GENERIC INFORMATION IS FINE AND DOES NOT COUNT AS A VIOLATION. Also, any privacy element identified, be it HIGH, LOW or MEDIUM SENSITIVITY BASED ON THE TAXONOMY PROVIDED ABOVE, AS LONG AS IT DOES NOT MENTION ANYTHING SPECIFIC LIKE NAMES OR NUMBERS, IT IS NOT A VIOLATION AND DO NOT INCLUDE IT UNDER VIOLATIONS AS SUCH. THIS IS APPLICABLE IRRESPECTIVE OF CONTEXT AND SETTINGS  - GENERIC INFORMATION (IRRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY BEING HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW) DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION! EVEN IF IT IS SEEN THAT SOME ELEMENT INDIRECTLY REVEALS SOMETHING, THEN THAT TOO IS NOT A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE NAMES OR NUMBERS, SO DO NOT COUNT IT UNDER VIOLATIONS!.  

** REMINDER: BARELY MENTIONING THE ELEMENTS IN A GENERIC FASHION LIKE GPS OR EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS ARE NOT VIOLATIONS, MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES, FACTS AND FIGURES CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION LIKE EXACT GPS COORDINATES, EXACT CREDIT CARD NUMBER OR EXACT HOTEL/ RESTAURANT NAMES - MERELY MENTIONING THE LOCATION TO BE A HOTEL OR HAVING A COMPLETELY/PARTIALLY CENSORED GPS/ CREDIT CARD/ BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY AND IN SUCH CASES THE SUMMARY IS FINE/ GOOD TO GO. THIS IS APPLICABLE IRRESPECTIVE OF CONTEXT AND SETTINGS  - GENERIC INFORMATION (IRRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY BEING HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW) DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION! EVEN IF IT IS SEEN THAT SOME ELEMENT INDIRECTLY REVEALS SOMETHING, THEN THAT TOO IS NOT A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE NAMES OR NUMBERS, SO DO NOT COUNT IT UNDER VIOLATIONS!.   **

MANDATORILY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE IN RESPONSE:

<BEGIN STRUCTURE>

<BEGIN LABEL>

** Either GOOD or BAD,  based on the extent to which the privacy elements mentioned in the metadata that need to be masked/ censored into something generic or omitted in the summary based on context and settings are actually censored instead of being openly exposed, i.e. the extent to which Privacy is preserved. If BAD then need to maintain and return a list of Violations as per the structure given below later on. Barely mentioning the elements in a generic fashion like GPS or expensive restaurants are not Violations, MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES, FACTS and FIGURES CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION like exact GPS coordinates, exact Credit Card Number or exact Hotel/ restaurant names - merely mentioning the location to be a hotel or having a completely/partially censored GPS/ Credit Card/ Bank Account number DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY AND IN SUCH CASES THE SUMMARY IS FINE/ GOOD TO GO. THIS IS APPLICABLE IRRESPECTIVE OF CONTEXT AND SETTINGS - GENERIC INFORMATION (IRRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY BEING HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW) DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION! EVEN IF IT IS SEEN THAT SOME ELEMENT INDIRECTLY REVEALS SOMETHING, THEN THAT TOO IS NOT A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE NAMES OR NUMBERS, SO DO NOT COUNT IT UNDER VIOLATIONS!.   **

<END LABEL>

<BEGIN VIOLATIONS>

** Depending on whether any of the privacy elements mentioned in the metadata that shouldn't be included in the summary based on context and settings, are actually included in the summary, create a list of such violations (IN THE EXACT TAXONOMY FORM PROVIDED ABOVE AND AS CAN BE SEEN IN THE METADATA AS WELL WHERE THE ELEMENTS can be as deep and specific as needed like family.high.marital_records.partners.names or can be as generic as employment.high.employment_status) with a single line explanation as to why it should have been masked and where it was included in the summary (insert the exact line here/ explain how it was revealed in the summary). Note that barely mentioning the elements in a generic fashion like mentioning GPS usage or expensive restaurants are not Violations, MENTIONING SPECIFIC NAMES, FACTS and FIGURES CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION like exact GPS coordinates, exact Credit Card Number or exact Hotel/ restaurant names - merely mentioning the location to be a hotel or having a completely/partially censored GPS/ Credit Card/ Bank Account number DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY AND IN SUCH CASES THE SUMMARY IS FINE/ GOOD TO GO. THIS IS APPLICABLE IRRESPECTIVE OF CONTEXT AND SETTINGS - GENERIC INFORMATION (IRRRESPECTIVE OF THE LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY BEING HIGH, MEDIUM OR LOW) DO NOT CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION! EVEN IF IT IS SEEN THAT SOME ELEMENT INDIRECTLY REVEALS SOMETHING, THEN THAT TOO IS NOT A VIOLATION AS IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANY SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE NAMES OR NUMBERS, SO DO NOT COUNT IT UNDER VIOLATIONS!.  

 Heres a sample output- 

	1. Violation 1 (Replace with the first violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary
	2. Violation 2 (Replace with the second violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
			a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

			b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary

			...... and so on 
			
	(Optional) If there are any other violations apart from those from the Metadata provided, then can include this part as well as it is optional:

			Other Violations:
				1. Other Violation 1 (Replace with the first other violation as per the taxonomy in the metadata):
						a.Why: Explain why the information should be masked based on context, settings, levels of sensitivity and relevance in summary to conversation setting.  

						b.How: Sentences from Summary revealing/ Explain how the sensitive information is revealed in the summary
								
						..... and so on	**

<END VIOLATIONS>

<END STRUCTURE>

I would now give you a summary within <BEGIN SUMMARY>......<END SUMMARY> Tags and its metadata within <BEGIN METADATA>......<END METADATA> Tags for which you MUST provide a detailed outcome regarding the quality of summary, covering all the possible violations of priavcy elements based on context, settings and requirememnts of the conversation, and also provide an explanation regarding the quality- if Good then "None.", If Bad then a series or a list of all the violations (note that generic information and anything that indirectly reveals something do not constitutes a violation in any context or setting, and same applies for any level of sensitivity for information - be it High, Low or Medium - as long as it doesn't directly reveal any specific data like Names and Numbers) and how they were done COMPULSORILY ADHEREING TO THE TAXONOMY AND STRICTLY IN THE RESPONSE FORMAT STRUCTURE PROVIDED ABOVE. Just provide me the Outcomes generated - Quality and Violations, NOTHING ELSE- NO NEED FOR SUMMARY, DIAGNOSIS, CONCLUSION OR EVEN A SINGLE LINE EXTRA. JUST RETURN THE OUTCOMES CONTENT.
